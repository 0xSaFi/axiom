A.2.  )abbreviation
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  compiler
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  -  )abbreviation query  [nameOrAbbrev]
  -  )abbreviation category  abbrev  fullname [)quiet]
  -  )abbreviation domain  abbrev  fullname   [)quiet]
  -  )abbreviation package  abbrev  fullname  [)quiet]
  -  )abbreviation remove  nameOrAbbrev
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used to query, set and remove abbreviations for category,
domain and package constructors. Every constructor must have a unique
abbreviation. This abbreviation is part of the name of the subdirectory under
which the components of the compiled constructor are stored. Furthermore, by
issuing this command you let the system know what file to load automatically
if you use a new constructor. Abbreviations must start with a letter and then
be followed by up to seven letters or digits. Any letters appearing in the
abbreviation must be in uppercase.
 
When used with the query argument, this command may be used to list the name
associated with a particular abbreviation or the abbreviation for a
constructor. If no abbreviation or name is given, the names and corresponding
abbreviations for all constructors are listed.
 
The following shows the abbreviation for the constructor List:
 
)abbreviation query List
 
The following shows the constructor name corresponding to the abbreviation
NNI:
 
)abbreviation query NNI
 
The following lists all constructor names and their abbreviations.
 
)abbreviation query
 
To add an abbreviation for a constructor, use this command with category,
domain or package. The following add abbreviations to the system for a
category, domain and package, respectively:
 
)abbreviation domain   SET Set
)abbreviation category COMPCAT  ComplexCategory
)abbreviation package  LIST2MAP ListToMap
 
If the )quiet option is used, no output is displayed from this command. You
would normally only define an abbreviation in a library source file. If this
command is issued for a constructor that has already been loaded, the
constructor will be reloaded next time it is referenced. In particular, you
can use this command to force the automatic reloading of constructors.
 
To remove an abbreviation, the remove argument is used. This is usually only
used to correct a previous command that set an abbreviation for a constructor
name. If, in fact, the abbreviation does exist, you are prompted for
confirmation of the removal request. Either of the following commands will
remove the abbreviation VECTOR2 and the constructor name VectorFunctions2
from the system:
 
)abbreviation remove VECTOR2
)abbreviation remove VectorFunctions2

User Level Required:  development
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  -  )boot bootExpression
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used by AXIOM system developers to execute expressions
written in the BOOT language. For example,
 
)boot times3(x) == 3*x
 
creates and compiles the Lisp function ``times3'' obtained by translating the
BOOT code.

====================================================================
A.4.  )cd
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  -  )cd directory
 
Command Description: 
 
This command sets the AXIOM working current directory. The current directory
is used for looking for input files (for )read), AXIOM library source files
(for )compile), saved history environment files (for )history )restore),
compiled AXIOM library files (for )library), and files to edit (for )edit).
It is also used for writing spool files (via )spool), writing history input
files (via )history )write) and history environment files (via )history
)save),and compiled AXIOM library files (via )compile).
 
If issued with no argument, this command sets the AXIOM current directory to
your home directory. If an argument is used, it must be a valid directory
name. Except for the ``)'' at the beginning of the command, this has the same
syntax as the operating system cd command.

)clear p all
)clear p x
)clear p x y f
 
All definitions of functions and values of variables may be removed by either
 
)clear value all
)clear v all
 
This retains whatever declarations the objects had. To remove definitions and
values for the specific objects x, y and f, issue
 
)clear value x y f
)clear v x y f
 
To remove the declarations of everything while leaving the definitions and
values, issue
 
)clear mode  all
)clear m all
 
To remove declarations for the specific objects x, y and f, issue
 
)clear mode x y f
)clear m x y f
 
The )display names and )display properties commands may be used to see what
is currently in the workspace.

User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )close
  - )close )quietly
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used to close down interpreter client processes. Such
processes are started by HyperDoc to run AXIOM examples when you click on
their text. When you have finished examining or modifying the example and you
do not want the extra window around anymore, issue
 
)close
 
to the AXIOM prompt in the window.
 
If you try to close down the last remaining interpreter client process, AXIOM
will offer to close down the entire AXIOM session and return you to the
operating system by displaying something like
 
   This is the last AXIOM session. Do you want to kill AXIOM?
 
Type "y" (followed by the Return key) if this is what you had in mind. Type
"n" (followed by the Return key) to cancel the command.
 
You can use the )quietly option to force AXIOM to close down the interpreter
client process without closing down the entire AXIOM session.

  -  )compile fileName )vartrace
  -  )compile fileName )constructor nameOrAbbrev
 
Command Description: 
 
You use this command to invoke the new AXIOM library compiler or the old
AXIOM system compiler. The )compile system command is actually a combination
of AXIOM processing and a call to the AXIOM-XL compiler. It is performing
double-duty, acting as a front-end to both the AXIOM-XL compiler and the old
AXIOM system compiler. (The old AXIOM system compiler was written in Lisp and
was an integral part of the AXIOM environment. The AXIOM-XL compiler is
written in C and executed by the operating system when called from within
AXIOM.)
 
The command compiles files with file extensions .as, .ao and .al with the
AXIOM-XL compiler and files with file extension .spad with the old AXIOM
system compiler. It also can compile files with file extension .lsp. These
are assumed to be Lisp files genererated by the AXIOM-XL compiler. If you
omit the file extension, the command looks to see if you have specified the
)new or )old option. If you have given one of these options, the
corresponding compiler is used. Otherwise, the command first looks in the
standard system directories for files with extension .as, .ao and .al and
then files with extension .spad. The first file found has the appropriate
compiler invoked on it. If the command cannot find a matching file, an error
message is displayed and the command terminates.
 
The )translate option is used to invoke a special version of the old system
compiler that will translate a .spad file to a .as file. That is, the .spad
file will be parsed and analyzed and a file using the new syntax will be
created. By default, the .as file is created in the same directory as the
.spad file. If that directory is not writable, the current directory is used.
If the current directory is not writable, an error message is given and the
command terminates. Note that )translate implies the )old option so the file
extension can safely be omitted. If )translate is given, all other options
are ignored. Please be aware that the translation is not necessarily one
hundred percent complete or correct. You should attempt to compile the output
with the AXIOM-XL compiler and make any necessary corrections.
 
We now describe the options for the new AXIOM-XL compiler.
 
The first thing )compile does is look for a source code filename among its
arguments. Thus
 
)compile mycode.as
)compile /u/jones/as/mycode.as
)compile mycode
 
all invoke )compiler on the file /u/jones/as/mycode.as if the current AXIOM
working directory is /u/jones/as. (Recall that you can set the working
directory via the )cd command. If you don't set it explicitly, it is the
directory from which you started AXIOM.)
 
This is frequently all you need to compile your file. This simple command:
 
  -  Invokes the AXIOM-XL compiler and produces Lisp output.
  -  Calls the Lisp compiler if the AXIOM-XL compilation was
  successful.
  -  Use the )library command to tell AXIOM about
  the contents of your compiled file and arrange to have those contents
  loaded on demand.
 
Should you not want the )library command automatically invoked, call )compile
with the )nolibrary option. For example,
 
)compile mycode.as )nolibrary
 
The general description of AXIOM-XL command line arguments is in the AXIOM-XL
documentation. The default options used by the )compile command can be viewed
and set using the )set compiler args AXIOM system command. The current
defaults are
 
-O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete -DAxiom
 
These options mean:
 
  -  -O: perform all optimizations,
  -  -Fasy: generate a .asy file,
  -  -Fao: generate a .ao file,
  -  -Flsp: generate a .lsp (Lisp)
  file,
  -  -laxiom: use the axiom library libaxiom.al,
  -  -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete: do not display messages
  about older generated files becoming obsolete, and
  -  -DAxiom: define the global assertion Axiom so that the
  AXIOM-XL libraries for generating stand-alone code are not accidentally
  used with AXIOM.
 
To supplement these default arguments, use the )moreargs option on )compile.
For example,
 
)compile mycode.as )moreargs "-v"
 
uses the default arguments and appends the -v (verbose) argument flag. The
additional argument specification must be enclosed in double quotes.
 
To completely replace these default arguments for a particular use of
)compile, use the )onlyargs option. For example,
 
)compile mycode.as )onlyargs "-v -O"
 
only uses the -v (verbose) and -O (optimize) arguments. The argument
specification must be enclosed in double quotes. In this example, Lisp code
is not produced and so the compilation output will not be available to AXIOM.
 
To completely replace the default arguments for all calls to )compile within
your AXIOM session, use )set compiler args. For example, to use the above
arguments for all compilations, issue
 
)set compiler args "-v -O"
 
Make sure you include the necessary -l and -Y arguments along with those
needed for Lisp file creation. As above, the argument specification must be
enclosed in double quotes.
 
By default, the )library system command exposes all domains and categories it
processes. This means that the AXIOM intepreter will consider those domains
and categories when it is trying to resolve a reference to a function.
Sometimes domains and categories should not be exposed. For example, a domain
may just be used privately by another domain and may not be meant for
top-level use. The )library command should still be used, though, so that the
code will be loaded on demand. In this case, you should use the )nolibrary
option on )compile and the )noexpose option in the )library command. For
example,
 
)compile mycode.as )nolibrary
)library mycode )noexpose
 
Once you have established your own collection of compiled code, you may find
it handy to use the )dir option on the )library command. This causes )library
to process all compiled code in the specified directory. For example,
 
)library )dir /u/jones/as/quantum
 
You must give an explicit directory after )dir, even if you want all compiled
code in the current working directory processed.
 
)library )dir .
 
The )compile command works with several file extensions. We saw above what
happens when it is invoked on a file with extension .as. A .ao file is a
portable binary compiled version of a .as file, and )compile simply passes
the .ao file onto AXIOM-XL. The generated Lisp file is compiled and )library
is automatically called, just as if you had specified a .as file.
 
A .al file is an archive file containing .ao files. The archive is created
(on Unix systems) with the ar program. When )compile is given a .al file, it
creates a directory whose name is based on that of the archive. For example,
if you issue
 
)compile mylib.al
 
the directory mylib.axldir is created. All members of the archive are
unarchived into the directory and )compile is called on each .ao file found.
It is your responsibility to remove the directory and its contents, if you
choose to do so.
 
A .lsp file is a Lisp source file, presumably, in our context, generated by
AXIOM-XL when called with the -Flsp option. When )compile is used with a .lsp
file, the Lisp file is compiled and )library is called. You must also have
present a .asy generated from the same source file.
 
The following are descriptions of options for the old system compiler.
 
You can compile category, domain, and package constructors contained in files
with file extension .spad. You can compile individual constructors or every
constructor in a file.
 
The full filename is remembered between invocations of this command and )edit
commands. The sequence of commands
 
)compile matrix.spad
)edit
)compile
 
will call the compiler, edit, and then call the compiler again on the file
matrix.spad. If you do not specify a directory, the working current directory
(see description of command )cd ) is searched for the file. If the file is
not found, the standard system directories are searched.
 
If you do not give any options, all constructors within a file are compiled.
Each constructor should have an )abbreviation command in the file in which it
is defined. We suggest that you place the )abbreviation commands at the top
of the file in the order in which the constructors are defined. The list of
commands serves as a table of contents for the file.
 
The )library option causes directories containing the compiled code for each
constructor to be created in the working current directory. The name of such
a directory consists of the constructor abbreviation and the .NRLIB file
extension. For example, the directory containing the compiled code for the
MATRIX constructor is called MATRIX.NRLIB. The )nolibrary option says that
such files should not be created. The default is )library. Note that the
semantics of )library and )nolibrary for the new AXIOM-XL compiler and for
the old system compiler are completely different.
 
The )vartrace option causes the compiler to generate extra code for the
constructor to support conditional tracing of variable assignments. (see
description of command )trace ). Without this option, this code is suppressed
and one cannot use the )vars option for the trace command.
 
The )constructor option is used to specify a particular constructor to
compile. All other constructors in the file are ignored. The constructor name
or abbreviation follows )constructor. Thus either
 
)compile matrix.spad )constructor RectangularMatrix
 
or
 
)compile matrix.spad )constructor RMATRIX
 
compiles the RectangularMatrix constructor defined in matrix.spad.
 
The )break and )nobreak options determine what the old system compiler does
when it encounters an error. )break is the default and it indicates that
processing should stop at the first error. The value of the )set break
variable then controls what happens.

Command Description: 
 
This command is used to display the contents of the workspace and signatures
of functions with a given name. (A signature gives the argument and return
types of a function.) 
 
The command
 
)display names
 
lists the names of all user-defined objects in the workspace. This is useful
if you do not wish to see everything about the objects and need only be
reminded of their names.
 
The commands
 
)display all
)display properties
)display properties all
 
all do the same thing: show the values and types and declared modes of all
variables in the workspace. If you have defined functions, their signatures
and definitions will also be displayed.
 
To show all information about a particular variable or user functions, for
example, something named d, issue
 
)display properties d
 
To just show the value (and the type) of d, issue
 
)display value d
 
To just show the declared mode of d, issue
 
)display mode d
 
All modemaps for a given operation may be displayed by using )display
operations. A modemap is a collection of information about a particular
reference to an operation. This includes the types of the arguments and the
return value, the location of the implementation and any conditions on the
types. The modemap may contain patterns. The following displays the modemaps
for the operation FromcomplexComplexCategory:

<<edit>>=
====================================================================
A.9.  )edit
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )edit [filename]
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used to edit files. It works in conjunction with the )read
and )compile commands to remember the name of the file on which you are
working. By specifying the name fully, you can edit any file you wish. Thus
 
)edit /u/julius/matrix.input
 
will place you in an editor looking at the file /u/julius/matrix.input. By
default, the editor is vi, but if you have an EDITOR shell environment
variable defined, that editor will be used. When AXIOM is running under the X
Window System, it will try to open a separate xterm running your editor if it
thinks one is necessary. For example, under the Korn shell, if you issue
 
export EDITOR=emacs
 
then the emacs editor will be used by )edit.
 
If you do not specify a file name, the last file you edited, read or compiled
will be used. If there is no ``last file'' you will be placed in the editor
editing an empty unnamed file.
 
It is possible to use the )system command to edit a file directly. For
example,
 
)system emacs /etc/rc.tcpip
 
calls emacs to edit the file.

  - )frame  drop  [frameName]
  - )frame  next
  - )frame  last
  - )frame  names
  - )frame  import frameName [objectName1 [objectName2 ...]]
  - )set message frame on | off
  - )set message prompt frame
 
Command Description: 
 
A frame can be thought of as a logical session within the physical session
that you get when you start the system. You can have as many frames as you
want, within the limits of your computer's storage, paging space, and so on.
Each frame has its own step number, environment and history. You can have a
variable named a in one frame and it will have nothing to do with anything
that might be called a in any other frame.
 
Some frames are created by the HyperDoc program and these can have pretty
strange names, since they are generated automatically. To find out the names
of all frames, issue
 
)frame names
 
It will indicate the name of the current frame.
 
You create a new frame ``quark'' by issuing
 
)frame new quark
 
The history facility can be turned on by issuing either )set history on or
)history )on. If the history facility is on and you are saving history
information in a file rather than in the AXIOM environment then a history
file with filename quark.axh will be created as you enter commands. If you
wish to go back to what you were doing in the ``initial'' frame, use
 
)frame next
 
or
 
)frame last
 
to cycle through the ring of available frames to get back to ``initial''.
 
If you want to throw away a frame (say ``quark''), issue
 
)frame drop quark
 
If you omit the name, the current frame is dropped.
 
If you do use frames with the history facility on and writing to a file, you
may want to delete some of the older history files. These are directories, so
you may want to issue a command like rm -r quark.axh to the operating system.
 
You can bring things from another frame by using )frame import. For example,
to bring the f and g from the frame ``quark'' to the current frame, issue
 
)frame import quark f g
 
If you want everything from the frame ``quark'', issue
 
)frame import quark
 
You will be asked to verify that you really want everything.
 
There are two )set flags to make it easier to tell where you are.
 
)set message frame on | off
 
will print more messages about frames when it is set on. By default, it is
off.
 
)set message prompt frame
 
will give a prompt that looks like
 
initial (1) ->
 
when you start up. In this case, the frame name and step make up the prompt.

All this material is available in the AXIOM User Guide and in HyperDoc. In
HyperDoc, choose the Commands item from the Reference menu.
 
====================================================================
A.1.  Introduction
====================================================================
 
 
System commands are used to perform AXIOM environment management. Among the
commands are those that display what has been defined or computed, set up
multiple logical AXIOM environments (frames), clear definitions, read files
of expressions and commands, show what functions are available, and terminate
AXIOM.
 
Some commands are restricted: the commands
 
)set userlevel interpreter
)set userlevel compiler
)set userlevel development
 
set the user-access level to the three possible choices. All commands are
available at development level and the fewest are available at interpreter
level. The default user-level is interpreter. In addition to the )set command
(discussed in description of command )set ) you can use the HyperDoc settings
facility to change the user-level. Click on [Settings] here to immediately go
to the settings facility. 
 
Each command listing begins with one or more syntax pattern descriptions plus
examples of related commands. The syntax descriptions are intended to be easy
to read and do not necessarily represent the most compact way of specifying
all possible arguments and options; the descriptions may occasionally be
redundant.
 
All system commands begin with a right parenthesis which should be in the
first available column of the input line (that is, immediately after the
input prompt, if any). System commands may be issued directly to AXIOM or be
included in .input files.
 
A system command argument is a word that directly follows the command name
and is not followed or preceded by a right parenthesis. A system command
option follows the system command and is directly preceded by a right
parenthesis. Options may have arguments: they directly follow the option.
This example may make it easier to remember what is an option and what is an
argument:
 
         )syscmd arg1 arg2 )opt1 opt1arg1 opt1arg2 )opt2 opt2arg1 ...
 
In the system command descriptions, optional arguments and options are
enclosed in brackets (``['' and ``]''). If an argument or option name is in
italics, it is meant to be a variable and must have some actual value
substituted for it when the system command call is made. For example, the
syntax pattern description
 
)read fileName [)quietly]
 
would imply that you must provide an actual file name for fileName but need
not use the )quietly option. Thus
 
)read matrix.input
 
is a valid instance of the above pattern.
 
System command names and options may be abbreviated and may be in upper or
lower case. The case of actual arguments may be significant, depending on the
particular situation (such as in file names). System command names and
options may be abbreviated to the minimum number of starting letters so that
the name or option is unique. Thus
 
)s Integer
 
is not a valid abbreviation for the )set command, because both )set and )show
begin with the letter ``s''. Typically, two or three letters are sufficient
for disambiguating names. In our descriptions of the commands, we have used
no abbreviations for either command names or options.
 
In some syntax descriptions we use a vertical line ``|'' to indicate that you
must specify one of the listed choices. For example, in
 
)set output fortran on | off
 
only on and off are acceptable words for following boot. We also sometimes
use ``...'' to indicate that additional arguments or options of the listed
form are allowed. Finally, in the syntax descriptions we may also list the
syntax of related commands.

Command Description: 
 
The history facility within AXIOM allows you to restore your environment to
that of another session and recall previous computational results. Additional
commands allow you to review previous input lines and to create an .input
file of the lines typed to AXIOM.
 
AXIOM saves your input and output if the history facility is turned on (which
is the default). This information is saved if either of
 
)set history on
)history )on
 
has been issued. Issuing either
 
)set history off
)history )off
 
will discontinue the recording of information.
 
Whether the facility is disabled or not, the value of % in AXIOM always
refers to the result of the last computation. If you have not yet entered
anything, % evaluates to an object of type Variable('%). The function %% may
be used to refer to other previous results if the history facility is
enabled. In that case, %%(n) is the output from step n if n > 0. If n < 0,
the step is computed relative to the current step. Thus %%(-1) is also the
previous step, %%(-2), is the step before that, and so on. If an invalid step
number is given, AXIOM will signal an error.
 
The environment information can either be saved in a file or entirely in
memory (the default). Each frame ( description of command )frame ) has its
own history database. When it is kept in a file, some of it may also be kept
in memory for efficiency. When the information is saved in a file, the name
of the file is of the form FRAME.axh where ``FRAME'' is the name of the
current frame. The history file is placed in the current working directory
(see description of command )cd ). Note that these history database files are
not text files (in fact, they are directories themselves), and so are not in
human-readable format.
 
The options to the )history command are as follows:
 
  )change n
    will set the number of steps that are saved in memory to n. This option
    only has effect when the history data is maintained in a file. If you
    have issued )history )memory (or not changed the default) there is no
    need to use )history )change.
 
  )on
    will start the recording of information. If the workspace is not empty,
    you will be asked to confirm this request. If you do so, the workspace
    will be cleared and history data will begin being saved. You can also
    turn the facility on by issuing )set history on.
 
  )off
    will stop the recording of information. The )history )show command will
    not work after issuing this command. Note that this command may be issued
    to save time, as there is some performance penalty paid for saving the
    environment data. You can also turn the facility off by issuing )set
    history off.
 
  )file
    indicates that history data should be saved in an external file on disk.
 
  )memory
    indicates that all history data should be kept in memory rather than
    saved in a file. Note that if you are computing with very large objects
    it may not be practical to kept this data in memory.
 
  )reset
    will flush the internal list of the most recent workspace calculations so
    that the data structures may be garbage collected by the underlying Lisp
    system. Like )history )change, this option only has real effect when
    history data is being saved in a file.
 
  )restore [savedHistoryName]
    completely clears the environment and restores it to a saved session, if
    possible. The )save option below allows you to save a session to a file
    with a given name. If you had issued )history )save jacobi the command
    )history )restore jacobi would clear the current workspace and load the
    contents of the named saved session. If no saved session name is
    specified, the system looks for a file called last.axh.
 
  )save savedHistoryName
    is used to save a snapshot of the environment in a file. This file is
    placed in the current working directory (see description of command )cd
    ). Use )history )restore to restore the environment to the state
    preserved in the file. This option also creates an input file containing
    all the lines of input since you created the workspace frame (for
    example, by starting your AXIOM session) or last did a )clear all or
    )clear completely.
 
  )show [n] [both]
    can show previous input lines and output results. )show will display up
    to twenty of the last input lines (fewer if you haven't typed in twenty
    lines). )show n will display up to n of the last input lines. )show both
    will display up to five of the last input lines and output results. )show
    n both will display up to n of the last input lines and output results.
 
  )write historyInputFile
    creates an .input file with the input lines typed since the start of the
    session/frame or the last )clear all or )clear completely. If
    historyInputFileName does not contain a period (``.'') in the filename,
    .input is appended to it. For example, )history )write chaos and )history
    )write chaos.input both write the input lines to a file called
    chaos.input in your current working directory. If you issued one or more
    )undo commands, )history )write eliminates all input lines backtracked
    over as a result of )undo. You can edit this file and then use )read to
    have AXIOM process the contents.

====================================================================
A.14.  )library
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )library libName1  [libName2 ...]
  - )library )dir dirName
  - )library )only objName1  [objlib2 ...]
  - )library )noexpose
 
Command Description: 
 
This command replaces the )load system command that was available in AXIOM
releases before version 2.0. The )library command makes available to AXIOM
the compiled objects in the libraries listed.
 
For example, if you )compile dopler.as in your home directory, issue )library
dopler to have AXIOM look at the library, determine the category and domain
constructors present, update the internal database with various properties of
the constructors, and arrange for the constructors to be automatically loaded
when needed. If the )noexpose option has not been given, the constructors
will be exposed (that is, available) in the current frame.
 
If you compiled a file with the old system compiler, you will have an NRLIB
present, for example, DOPLER.NRLIB, where DOPLER is a constructor
abbreviation. The command )library DOPLER will then do the analysis and
database updates as above.
 
To tell the system about all libraries in a directory, use )library )dir
dirName where dirName is an explicit directory. You may specify ``.'' as the
directory, which means the current directory from which you started the
system or the one you set via the )cd command. The directory name is required.
 
You may only want to tell the system about particular constructors within a
library. In this case, use the )only option. The command )library dopler
)only Test1 will only cause the Test1 constructor to be analyzed, autoloaded,
etc..
 
Finally, each constructor in a library are usually automatically exposed when
the )library command is used. Use the )noexpose option if you not want them
exposed. At a later time you can use )set expose add constructor to expose
any hidden constructors.
 
Note for AXIOM beta testers: At various times this command was called )local
and )with before the name )library became the official name.

Entering printable keys generally inserts new text into the buffer (unless
in overwrite mode, see below).  Other special keys can be used to modify
the text in the buffer.  In the description of the keys below, ^n means
Control-n, or holding the CONTROL key down while pressing "n".  Errors
will ring the terminal bell.

^A/^E	: Move cursor to beginning/end of the line.
^F/^B   : Move cursor forward/backward one character.
^D	: Delete the character under the cursor.
^H, DEL : Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
^K	: Kill from the cursor to the end of line.
^L	: Redraw current line.
^O	: Toggle overwrite/insert mode. Initially in insert mode. Text
	  added in overwrite mode (including yanks) overwrite
	  existing text, while insert mode does not overwrite.
^P/^N   : Move to previous/next item on history list.
^R/^S   : Perform incremental reverse/forward search for string on
	  the history list.  Typing normal characters adds to the current
	  search string and searches for a match. Typing ^R/^S marks
	  the start of a new search, and moves on to the next match.
	  Typing ^H or DEL deletes the last character from the search 
	  string, and searches from the starting location of the last search.  
	  Therefore, repeated DEL's appear to unwind to the match nearest 
	  the point at which the last ^R or ^S was typed.  If DEL is 
	  repeated until the search string is empty the search location 
	  begins from the start of the history list.  Typing ESC or 
	  any other editing character accepts the current match and 
	  loads it into the buffer, terminating the search.
^T	: Toggle the characters under and to the left of the cursor.
^Y	: Yank previously killed text back at current location.  Note that
	  this will overwrite or insert, depending on the current mode.
^U      : Show help (this text).
TAB	: Perform command completion based on word to the left of the cursor. 
          Words are deemed to contain only the alphanumeric and the % ! ? _  
          characters.
NL, CR  : returns current buffer to the program.

DOS and ANSI terminal arrow key sequences are recognized, and act like:

  up    : same as ^P
  down  : same as ^N
  left  : same as ^B
  right : same as ^F

Command Description: 
 
This command is used to terminate AXIOM and return to the operating system.
Other than by redoing all your computations or by using the )history )restore
command to try to restore your working environment, you cannot return to
AXIOM in the same state.
 
)pquit differs from the )quit in that it always asks for confirmation that
you want to terminate AXIOM (the ``p'' is for ``protected''). When you enter
the )pquit command, AXIOM responds
 
      Please enter y or yes if you really want to leave the interactive 
                environment and return to the operating system:
 
If you respond with y or yes, you will see the message
 
            You are now leaving the AXIOM interactive environment. 
    Issue the command axiom to the operating system to start a new session.
 
and AXIOM will terminate and return you to the operating system (or the
environment from which you invoked the system). If you responded with
something other than y or yes, then the message
 
        You have chosen to remain in the AXIOM interactive environment.

This command remembers the previous file you edited, read or compiled. If you
do not specify a file name, the previous file will be read.
 
The )ifthere option checks to see whether the .input file exists. If it does
not, the )read command does nothing. If you do not use this option and the

Command Description: 
 
The )set command is used to view or set system variables that control what
messages are displayed, the type of output desired, the status of the history
facility, the way AXIOM user functions are cached, and so on. Since this
collection is very large, we will not discuss them here. Rather, we will show
how the facility is used. We urge you to explore the )set options to
familiarize yourself with how you can modify your AXIOM working environment.
There is a HyperDoc version of this same facility available from the main
HyperDoc menu. Click [here] to go to it. 
 
The )set command is command-driven with a menu display. It is
tree-structured. To see all top-level nodes, issue )set by itself.
 
)set
 
Variables with values have them displayed near the right margin. Subtrees of
selections have ``...'' displayed in the value field. For example, there are
many kinds of messages, so issue )set message to see the choices.
 
)set message
 
The current setting for the variable that displays whether computation times
are displayed is visible in the menu displayed by the last command. To see
more information, issue
 
)set message time
 
This shows that time printing is on now. To turn it off, issue
 
)set message time off
 
As noted above, not all settings have so many qualifiers. For example, to

Command Description: 
This command displays information about AXIOM domain, package and category
constructors. If no options are given, the )operations option is assumed. For
example,
 
)show POLY
)show POLY )operations
)show Polynomial
)show Polynomial )operations
 
each display basic information about the Polynomial domain constructor and
then provide a listing of operations. Since Polynomial requires a Ring (for
example, Integer) as argument, the above commands all refer to a unspecified
ring R. In the list of operations, $ means Polynomial(R).
 
The basic information displayed includes the signature of the constructor
(the name and arguments), the constructor abbreviation, the exposure status
of the constructor, and the name of the library source file for the
constructor.
 
If operation information about a specific domain is wanted, the full or
abbreviated domain name may be used. For example,
 
)show POLY INT
)show POLY INT )operations
)show Polynomial Integer
)show Polynomial Integer )operations
 
are among the combinations that will display the operations exported by the
domain Polynomial(Integer) (as opposed to the general domain constructor
Polynomial). Attributes may be listed by using the )attributes option.

Command Description: 
 
This command may be used to issue commands to the operating system while
remaining in AXIOM. The cmdExpression is passed to the operating system for
execution.
 
To get an operating system shell, issue, for example, )system sh. When you
enter the key combination, Ctrl-D (pressing and holding the Ctrl key and then
pressing the D key) the shell will terminate and you will return to AXIOM. We
do not recommend this way of creating a shell because Lisp may field some
interrupts instead of the shell. If possible, use a shell running in another
window.
 
If you execute programs that misbehave you may not be able to return to
AXIOM. If this happens, you may have no other choice than to restart AXIOM
and restore the environment via )history )restore, if possible.

  - )within executingFunction
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used to trace the execution of functions that make up the
AXIOM system, functions defined by users, and functions from the system
library. Almost all options are available for each type of function but
exceptions will be noted below.
 
To list all functions, constructors, domains and packages that are traced,
simply issue
 
)trace
 
To untrace everything that is traced, issue
 
)trace )off
 
When a function is traced, the default system action is to display the
arguments to the function and the return value when the function is exited.
Note that if a function is left via an action such as a THROW, no return
value will be displayed. Also, optimization of tail recursion may decrease
the number of times a function is actually invoked and so may cause less
trace information to be displayed. Other information can be displayed or
collected when a function is traced and this is controlled by the various
options. Most options will be of interest only to AXIOM system developers. If
a domain or package is traced, the default action is to trace all functions
exported.
 
Individual interpreter, lisp or boot functions can be traced by listing their
names after )trace. Any options that are present must follow the functions to
be traced.
 
)trace f
 
traces the function f. To untrace f, issue
 
)trace f )off
 
Note that if a function name contains a special character, it will be
necessary to escape the character with an underscore
 
)trace _/D_,1
 
To trace all domains or packages that are or will be created from a
particular constructor, give the constructor name or abbreviation after
)trace.
 
)trace MATRIX
)trace List Integer
 
The first command traces all domains currently instantiated with Matrix. If
additional domains are instantiated with this constructor (for example, if
you have used Matrix(Integer) and Matrix(Float)), they will be automatically
traced. The second command traces List(Integer). It is possible to trace
individual functions in a domain or package. See the )ops option below.
 
The following are the general options for the )trace command.
 
  )break after
    causes a Lisp break loop to be entered after exiting the traced function.
 
  )break before
    causes a Lisp break loop to be entered before entering the traced
    function.
 
  )break
    is the same as )break before.
 
  )count
    causes the system to keep a count of the number of times the traced
    function is entered. The total can be displayed with )trace )stats and
    cleared with )trace )stats reset.
 
  )count n
    causes information about the traced function to be displayed for the
    first n executions. After the nth execution, the function is untraced.
 
  )depth n
    causes trace information to be shown for only n levels of recursion of
    the traced function. The command
 
    )trace fib )depth 10
 
    will cause the display of only 10 levels of trace information for the
    recursive execution of a user function fib.
 
  )math
    causes the function arguments and return value to be displayed in the
    AXIOM monospace two-dimensional math format.
 
  )nonquietly
    causes the display of additional messages when a function is traced.
 
  )nt
    This suppresses all normal trace information. This option is useful if
    the )count or )timer options are used and you are interested in the
    statistics but not the function calling information.
 
  )off
    causes untracing of all or specific functions. Without an argument, all
    functions, constructors, domains and packages are untraced. Otherwise,
    the given functions and other objects are untraced. To immediately
    retrace the untraced functions, issue )trace )restore.
 
  )only listOfDataToDisplay
    causes only specific trace information to be shown. The items are listed
    by using the following abbreviations:
 
    a        display all arguments
    v        display return value
    1        display first argument
    2        display second argument
    15       display the 15th argument, and so on
 
  )restore
    causes the last untraced functions to be retraced. If additional options
    are present, they are added to those previously in effect.
 
  )stats
    causes the display of statistics collected by the use of the )count and
    )timer options.
 
  )stats reset
    resets to 0 the statistics collected by the use of the )count and )timer
    options.
 
  )timer
    causes the system to keep a count of execution times for the traced
    function. The total can be displayed with )trace )stats and cleared with
    )trace )stats reset.
 
  )varbreak var1 [... varN]
    causes a Lisp break loop to be entered after the assignment to any of the
    listed variables in the traced function.
 
  )vars
    causes the display of the value of any variable after it is assigned in
    the traced function. Note that library code must have been compiled (see
    description of command )compile ) using the )vartrace option in order to
    support this option.
 
  )vars var1 [... varN]
    causes the display of the value of any of the specified variables after
    they are assigned in the traced function. Note that library code must
    have been compiled (see description of command )compile ) using the
    )vartrace option in order to support this option.
 
  )within executingFunction
    causes the display of trace information only if the traced function is
    called when the given executingFunction is running.
 
The following are the options for tracing constructors, domains and packages.
 
  )local [op1 [... opN]]
    causes local functions of the constructor to be traced. Note that to
    untrace an individual local function, you must use the fully qualified
    internal name, using the escape character _ before the semicolon.
 
    )trace FRAC )local
    )trace FRAC_;cancelGcd )off
 
  )ops op1 [... opN]
    By default, all operations from a domain or package are traced when the
    domain or package is traced. This option allows you to specify that only
    particular operations should be traced. The command
 
    )trace Integer )ops min max _+ _-
 
    traces four operations from the domain Integer. Since + and - are special
    characters, it is necessary to escape them with an underscore.

\section{undo}
<<undo>>=
====================================================================
A.27.  )undo
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )undo
  - )undo integer
  - )undo integer [option]
  - )undo )redo
 
where option is one of
 
  - )after
  - )before
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used to restore the state of the user environment to an
earlier point in the interactive session. The argument of an )undo is an
integer which must designate some step number in the interactive session.
 
)undo n
)undo n )after
 
These commands return the state of the interactive environment to that
immediately after step n. If n is a positive number, then n refers to step
nummber n. If n is a negative number, it refers to the nth previous command
(that is, undoes the effects of the last -n commands).
 
A )clear all resets the )undo facility. Otherwise, an )undo undoes the effect
of )clear with options properties, value, and mode, and that of a previous
undo. If any such system commands are given between steps n and n + 1 (n >
0), their effect is undone for )undo m for any 0 < m <= n .
 
The command )undo is equivalent to )undo -1 (it undoes the effect of the
previous user expression). The command )undo 0 undoes any of the above system
commands issued since the last user expression.
 
)undo n )before
 
This command returns the state of the interactive environment to that
immediately before step n. Any )undo or )clear system commands given before
step n will not be undone.
 
)undo )redo
 
This command reads the file redo.input. created by the last )undo command.
This file consists of all user input lines, excluding those backtracked over
due to a previous )undo.
 
Also See: 
o )history
The command )history )write will eliminate the ``undone'' command lines of
your program.

\section{what}
<<what>>=
====================================================================
A.28.  )what
====================================================================
 
User Level Required:  interpreter
 
Command Syntax: 
 
  - )what categories pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what commands   pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what domains    pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what operations pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what packages   pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what synonym    pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )what things     pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
  - )apropos         pattern1 [pattern2 ...]
 
Command Description: 
 
This command is used to display lists of things in the system. The patterns
are all strings and, if present, restrict the contents of the lists. Only
those items that contain one or more of the strings as substrings are
displayed. For example,
 
)what synonym
 
displays all command synonyms,
 
)what synonym ver
 
displays all command synonyms containing the substring ``ver'',
 
)what synonym ver pr
 
displays all command synonyms containing the substring ``ver'' or the
substring ``pr''. Output similar to the following will be displayed
 
---------------- System Command Synonyms -----------------
 

user-defined synonyms satisfying patterns:
      ver pr
 

  )apr ........................... )what things
  )apropos ....................... )what things
  )prompt ........................ )set message prompt
  )version ....................... )lisp *yearweek*
 
Several other things can be listed with the )what command:
 
  categories displays a list of category constructors.
  commands  displays a list of  system commands available  at your
    user-level. Your user-level is set via the )set userlevel command. To get
    a description of a particular command, such as ``)what'', issue )help
    what.
  domains   displays a list of domain constructors.
  operations displays a list of operations in  the system library.
    It is recommended that you qualify this command with one or more
    patterns, as there are thousands of operations available. For example,
    say you are looking for functions that involve computation of
    eigenvalues. To find their names, try )what operations eig. A rather
    large list of operations is loaded into the workspace when this command
    is first issued. This list will be deleted when you clear the workspace
    via )clear all or )clear completely. It will be re-created if it is
    needed again.
  packages  displays a list of package constructors.
  synonym  lists system command synonyms.
  things    displays all  of the  above types for  items containing
    the pattern strings as substrings. The command synonym )apropos is
    equivalent to )what things.
