August 2014 release notes

This release moves Axiom to the latest GCL version.

March 2012 Release

A new volume, Volume 8.1, the Axiom Gallery shows examples of Axiom
graphics. These are test cases being collected to show capabilities
of the graphics subsystems.

One of the outstanding graphics bugs was 7217 which gave odd values
for graphics labels. This was fixed by picking up Waldek's patch for
coercion to InputForm. This had the unfortunate side effect that a
large number of Axiom's 35,000 test cases needed to be updated.

A particularly interesting article on Literate Programming and
Reproducible Research was published in the Journal of Statistical
Software and was added to the documentation page.
(http://www.jstatsoft.org/v46/i03/paper)

There are two new commands, )tangle and )regress.

A new function, getAncestors was added to the API domain.

The buglist was published and several bugs were added.

New references to Axiom were added to the bibliography, including
Dav12, Jen79, Dav80

Several people contributed to this release, including James Davenport,
Mark Clements, George Legendre, and Waldek Hebisch

November 2011 Release

Treeshaking the interpreter and compiler continues and a few more files
were merged and removed.

Several books and Makefiles were converted to use lisp tangle rather 
than noweb. This is part of the general process to remove noweb.

Global function rewrites continue, including removing GETREFV and makeprop.

Work was done to improve OpenMath support. The OpenMath semantics CDs were
added and the OpenMath parser was enhanced.

More effort was put into literate work. In particular, an example of a
literate program using HTML was created and presented at the Clojure/Conj
conference.

May 2011 Release

This release involved more work treeshaking of the compiler and
interpreter. Argument naming conventions were normalized to improve
the documentation and clarity.

Time was spent proofreading the books and reducing or eliminating
latex warnings. Missing index files were fixed and errors in the Jenks
book were fixed.

The website has been updated to make Arthur Ralf's book available
from every page. The website is being rewritten to be IPv6 enabled.

Doug Telford was added to the credits.

July 2010 Release

This release concentrated on the work of Albert Rich and his Rubi pattern
matching machinery. All of his integrals from his test suite were converted
to a regression test suite. This will form a baseline for the pattern work
in future releases. David Parnas has a table-based method of specifying
programs. Axiom is trying to synthesize this work with the pattern match
work to create pattern specifications using tables. Martin Baker added
HTML output to the system. Waldek Hebisch implemented the DoubleFloat
representation routines. Martin Rubey implemented Dirichlet.

The symbolic version of the fresnel integrals was added as well as a
numeric implementation of the fresnelC and fresnelS functions. The
output of these numeric functions were validated against Pearcy's tables,
with the comparison as part of the regression tests. Further work on
numeric approximation is ongoing and expected in the next release.

These people were added to the credits list:

March 29, 2010 release notes

This release concentrated on treeshaking more code into the Interpreter
volume. Support for )set break quit was added. Additional documentation
was added for branch cuts and clifford algebras. The first draft of a
new volume (10.5) on Numerics was added. An example of unicode was tested
to fulfill the long-term goal of unicode I/O support. 

This release is an interim step in the process of merging the interpreter
source code into a single volume. Due to the size and complexity of the
task it will take several releases.

Three people were added to the credits list:
   John P. Fletcher <J.P.Fletcher@aston.ac.uk>
   Nathaniel Daly <nathaniel.daly@gmail.com
   Ted Kosan <ted.kosan@gmail.com>

The Axiom website was completely rewritten based on a new style css
provided by Nate. This change was also made to axiom-developer.com.

There is a new set option "set break quit" per Ralf Hemmecke.
This will cause the interpreter to quit on failure. Documentation
was added to the books.

The major changes are:
   A new )describe command, boot language removal, and more motion
   toward a fully literate system.

The )describe command was added.

   The )describe function was added to Volume 5 (Interpreter)
   The )describe function was documented in Volume 2 (Users Guide)
   The Description field for the Categories, Domains, and Packages 
   were cleanup up and reformatted in Volumes 10.2 (Categories)
   10.3 (Domains) and 10.4 (Packages)
 

Boot Language removal

    All of the boot-converted lisp files were reformatted from their 
    compiler generated output. These files are being merged into
    Volume 5 (Interpreter) and Volume 9 (Compiler) as appropriate.
    This work will continue for the next few releases.

    All or portions of the following files were merged into 
    Volume 5 (Interpreter):
      astr, cstream.lisp, dq, incl, int-top, i-syscmd, msg, nci,
      obey, osyscmd, parini, patches, pile, scan

    The src/boot subdirectory is gone, including the files:
      Makefile, boot-proclaims, boothdr, bootload, btincl2, btpile2,
      btscan2, ccl-bootsys, ccl-depsys.lsp, exports.lisp, npextras, ptyout,
      tyextra, typars, typrops, tytree1, sys-pkg, vmlisp, ptrees, wi2

    The bootsys image is no longer part of the build process


Patch ports from Fricas and Open-Axiom

    The Tuples patch was picked up and applied.

    The SXHASH function is the hash default in SetCategory

    The function ListOfTerms was renamed to listOfTerms


Input file changes

    New input files have been added to show how to compute
    results using Axiom or to create regression tests for fixes:
      complexfactor, rubey, zimmbron, branchcut, cachedf, finitegraph,
      newtonlisp, nonlinhomodiffeq, distexpr, numericgamma, donsimple
      solveperf, tuplebug, unit-macro, testprob, unittest2

    lexp was removed and moved to the LEXP algebra file

    dop and gstbl had minor fixes

New Help files and Function examples were added

    There are new help files:
      describe, AlgebraicallyClosedField, RationalFunctionSum,
      RadicalSolvePackage, PartialFractionPackage, Product,
      OrderedFreeMonoid

Website update:

  The developer.html page was rewritten. An old Scratchpad group
  photo was added to the site.

  Work continues on re-hosting the axiom-developer.org domain.

  We now own axiom-developer.com and axiom-developer.net which will
  be retargetted to the new host as soon as it is available

Interpreter changes:

    Axiom will sit in a single package in the near future.
    The VMLISP package was partially removed from the system.
    Work continues on this path.

    The util.ht file is created earlier in the parallel build
    so there are fewer compiler messages about documentation.

Research:
 
    A Cohen algebra domain is being developed to enable symbolic
    manipulation of expressions with explanations and controlled
    simplification.

A major project milestone has been achieved with this release.
Axiom is implemented in lisp, removing all code in Boot.

The major effort in this release has been the boot to lisp rewrite.
There are several follow-on phases which are "in-process" but only
partially complete with this release. These include:
  source cleanup - 
    generating warning-free compiles which involves cleaning up the
    boot-to-lisp artifacts
  generating unit tests
    unit tests are being developed for each of the translated files to
    ensure that the rewrite does not introduce bugs
  file merge
    the individual files are being prepared to merge into the interpreter
    and compiler volumes.
  global variable handling
    the system uses many globals which are being either explained or
    rewritten to reduce coupling
  data structure extraction
    the various data structures used by the compiler and interpreter 
    are being identified and explained
  API vs implementation 
    the functions used externally vs the functions used internally are 
    being identified
  code refactoring
    the generated lisp code is being rewritten into human form without
    changing the behavior

The target goal is to have the code cleanly merged into the interpreter
and compiler volumes in a logical way that form chapters related to function.

Additional changes in this release include:

  Add Steven Segletes to credits. He was the author of the paper that
  supplied the coefficients for computing E1. He has contributed a later,
  unpublished paper which has more accurate coefficients. This is in-plan
  to implement.

  Barry Trager contributed an example of computing Shannon Matrices.
  This has been added to the input/regression suite.

  The .dvi files for the interpreter are no longer being built. The
  individual pamphlets will shortly disappear.

  Debugsys is no longer built. I am the only user of it and I can build
  it when needed.

  Bootsys is no longer built. It is no longer needed.

  The Makefiles now use the := rather than = assignment limiting re-evals

  Parallel Make is now the default since the documentation build is now 
  independent of the interpreter build

The syntactic conversion from the prior #1 form to the +-> form
is complete except for the GUESS package. Both forms still work
but the #1 form is discouraged.


All algebra files from src/algebra are now in books.


Work has concentrated on the hyperdoc browser. 
  * The browser files which get autoloaded into the interpreter were
    merged and removed in preparation for being rewritten into book form.
  * Glossary files were missing from the build and were added.


Work has started on a new CATS collection of verified algebraic identities,
the tpiezas set. See http://sites.google.com/site/tpiezas

Axiom now supports latex chunk syntax in pamphlets, thus
Axiom pamphlets can now be pure latex. 
Axiom can now read pamphlet files and extract latex chunks directly.
All input files were converted to the new format.

This change has several long term implications. Once all of the 
pamphlet files are pure latex we no longer need the NOWEAVE function.
Once Axiom can read all of its input formats, that is, )read and )compile
work directly on their pamphlet forms we will no longer need NOTANGLE.
At that point, we no longer need noweb.

This release sees the introduction of new domains and packages
as well as more documentation. The original Jenks books has been
modified to include new documentation, more help files were added,
and the )d op function documentation was expanded.

More effort has been applied to collecting interpreter and compiler
code into literate form in book volume 5.

A new effort to collect the compiler code into book volume 9 started.

The compiler was modified (by Waldek) to allow +-> in place of #1 syntax.
This conversion is nearly complete, with only a few packages remaining
to be converted. Lisp code to regression check the algebra changes was
written so the generated algebra is parsed and highlighted.

A method for running Axiom on Windows was developed and documented
on the home page of the website.

Unit testing of interpreter and compiler changes was added to the
regression testing. This will expand in future versions as changes
are made so ensure that things continue to function.

There were two major changes in this release.

First is the completion of the first phase of Book Volume 10.4: Axiom
Packages, which collects all of the packages into one document. The
side effect is to remove almost all of the remaining algebra files
leaving src/algebra nearly empty.

Second is the start of Book Volume 5: Axiom Interpreter which will
consolidate all of the interpreter functions and document them in
book form. A side effect of this consolidation will be the ultimate
removal of all boot code, with the further side effect of removing
bootsys from the build step and boot translation time.

While consolidating the interpreter code a parallel effort will be
ongoing to build Book Volume 9: Axiom Compiler. The idea is to split
the compiler code from the interpreter code so the compiler can be
documented and upgraded.

Book Volume 0: Axiom Jenks book
  Add )include documentation

    The original book did not document the )include command. This is
    now documented.

  Add UnivariateSkewPolynomial

    This domain was added to the domain examples 

Book Volume 4: Axiom Developers Guide
  Hyperdoc

    A Hyperdoc tutorial on making new pages was written

    A tutorial on spadhelp was added

Book Volume 5: Axiom Interpreter
  Command Handling
    
    The top level commands that start with open parenthesis are all
    kept in the $setOptions data structure. This structure was documented.
    Each command has a handler routine which was integrated with the
    structure in the proper place. 

  New latex macros

    The \defun and \defmacro macros were added to ensure that
    there is a uniform handling of subsections and cross references
    for all functions and macros.

    The \defdollar macro was added to handle $foo variables in
    both index and cross reference.

    The \cmdhead macro was added to provide uniform handling of
    each of the top level commands in the $setOptions data structure

  Unit testing

    To ensure that changes did not break behavior two new regression
    test routines were added, unittest1 and setcmd. These test the
    top level command behavior.

  Trace functions added

    The trace.boot code was added. 

Book Volume 7: Axiom Hyperdoc
  Documentation

    Add Scott Morrison's original hypertex plan notes

Book Volume 10.1: Axiom Algebra Theory
  Documentation

    Add tutorial chapter on Singular Value Decomposition

Book Volume 10.3 Axiom Domains
  Algebra fixes

    Johannes Grabmeier fixed the outputFixed behavior in Float.

    A regression test chunk was added to the Float domain.

    UnivariateSkewPolynomial was documented. A regression test,
    help file, and examples were added.

    Heap was documented. A regression test, help file, and 
    examples were added.

    Dequeue was documented. A regression test, help file, and 
    examples were added.

    Queue was documented. A regression test, help file, and 
    examples were added.

    ArrayStack was documented. A regression test, help file, and 
    examples were added.

    Stack was documented. A regression test, help file, and 
    examples were added.

    NottinghamGroup was added, including regression and help files.
    Originally written by Martin Rubey.

  Regression tests

    The )sys rm now uses the -f flag to force deletion on all
    regression test files

Book Volume 10.4 Axiom Packages
  New Algebra

    All packages were moved into this volume. Almost all of the
    remaining algebra files were deleted.

    ApplicationProgramInterface (API) was added. It exposes the
    Axiom internal functions at the algebra level.

    UnivariateSkewPolynomial now has help, input, and examples

  Documentation

    The nag man pages were added to the related domain documentation

    Export lists were added for all packages.

  Regression tests

    The )sys rm now uses the -f flag to force deletion on all regression
    test files.

Boot to Lisp rewrite
  Deleted boot files

    setvars.boot is gone. The code has been rewritten and added to
    book volume 5. The code was rewritten and/or reformatted. All
    compile-time warnings were eliminated.

    setvart.boot is gone. The code has been rewritten and added to
    book volume 5. The code was rewritten and/or reformatted. All
    compile-time warnings were eliminated.

    trace.boot is gone. The code has been rewritten and added to
    book volume 5. The code was rewritten and/or reformatted. All 
    compile-time warnings were eliminated.

Regression test 
  cleanup
    )set break resume

     A subtle bug in regression testing caused by early exit of a
     test left some of the regression tests reporting success when
     there should have been failure. This was fixed by adding a
     )set break resume command to allow Axiom to continue the testing
     in the presence of an internal fault.

  new

     setcmd.input was added to regression test changes to the )set
     top level command
   
     unittest1.input was added to regresstion test other top level
     commands

     dop.input was added to unit test )d op example output

     frame.input was added to unit test frame handling

  removed

     bags.input was distributed among the algebra regression test
     files and bags.input was removed.

Bug fixes

  Bug 7183. The library handling code was repaired. Functions which do
  not exist were removed (e.g. input-libraries). The element values of
  the data structure are now pathnames.

  Bug 7182. )set mes auto did not indicate the current value. 

  Bug 7180: )set compiler input add foo triggers a call to open-library
  which was a CCL function and no longer implemented. The elements of
  the data structure were changed.  

  Bug 7179. Suprious sensitivity to )abb in documentation caused
  breakage because this was assumed to be an )abbreviation command.

  Bug 7178. Missing function inspect in ArrayStack

  Bug 7177. Missing function map! in ArrayStack

  Bug 7176. Missing function parts in ArrayStack

  Bug 7175. Missing function map in ArrayStack

  Bug 7170: )d op output failure due to X in algebra comments. The X
  symbol is now a marker for )d op examples and the use of X in comments
  is ambiguous.

  Bug 7141: )cd relative does not work

One major theme of this release was restructuring the system
to move all domains to literate form in book volume 10.3

A second major theme was the first Axiom youtube tutorial video.



Book Volume 0: Axiom Reference

  Remove obsolete references to SmallFloat

Book Volume 1: Axiom Tutorial

  Remove obsolete references to SmallFloat

Book Volume 4: Axiom Developers Guide

  Add section on generating graphviz graphs

Book Volume 7.1: Axiom Hyperdoc

  Give a complete path to htadd

Book Volume 10.3 Axiom Domains

  All domains have been removed from the algebra subdirectory 
  and are now in literate form in book volume 10.3. Some
  domains include a help file, a regression test suite, and
  --X function examples for the )display command. Future work
  will extend this set.

  Each domain has a fully indexed list of functions exported.
  This allows hyperlinked access to functions.

  Each domain includes a graph segment that shows the list of
  categories, domains, and packages that provide immediate
  support in the prior build layer.

  Each domain includes a dotabb chunk which contains the
  source code necessary to recreate the graph.

  Domains which were associated with other domains in the same
  original spad file have hyperlinks to connect them.
  

Book Volume 11: Axiom Browser

  Lighten Bayou theme background image

Axiom Website (src/axiom-website)
  
  The axiom website is now under git control.
  The source tree is in src/axiom-website in the distribution.

  The build order graph exists. It contains a graph of all the
  constraints for each level. A line in the graph connects each
  category, domain, and package to every category, domain, and
  package in the prior layer that is required for the build.
  Multilayer constraints are not shown (although the data is
  in src/algebra/Makefile chunks) because the graph would be 
  too complex. 
    http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/hp.svg

  The Computer Algebra Test Suite (CATS) has a new test suite
  for ordinary differential equations (kamke*)
    http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/CATS

  The Ubuntu download now advises XTerm*metaSendsEscape: true
  due to misconfiguration of the meta key in emacs.
    http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/documentation.html

  A new binary for vector linux was added
    http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/download.html

  A new binary for doyen thumbdrive was added
  (work by Jose Alfredo Portes)
    http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/download.html

  The screenshots were recreated so the sources would be available.
  for matrixinmatrix.jpg, heatequation.jpg, axiomfirefox.jpg
    http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/screenshots.html

  The Axiom Information Sources video page was added, including
  a link to the youtube video, a local copy, and the supporting PDF.
    http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/videos.html

  A broken link to Book Volume 0: Axiom Reference was fixed.


Algebra (src/algebra)

  All domains were removed from spad files and moved to 
  Book Volume 10.3 Axiom Domains

  The Makefile now contains the information necessary to
  construct the build order graph as literate chunks.

  The layers were restructured. Files were moved to ensure
  that each file was at its lowest possible layer.

  The Guess package was added. However, due to nonstandard
  package files the guess function does not yet work properly.
  These packages are being rewritten.

  The Guess package has circular references. A new clique
  mechanism was added to the Makefile to handle this.

  Automatic regression test files associated with the algebra
  sources were reviewed for conforming to regression standards.

  integer.spad was reverted to remove an algebra change that
  causes a regression (cherry picked from Fricas in 2007)

Interpreter (src/interp)

  Tim Lahey added to )credits
  Karl Hegbloom added to )credits

  htcheck.boot moves util.ht to the mnt/doc directory

  setq.lisp no longer had redundant release data information
 
  nrunfast.boot Float has exp : Float -> Float now works
  This change was cherry-picked from Fricas.


Testing (src/input)

  All regression test files were reviewed and cleaned to
  conform to a standard setup.

  A parallel build race condition was fixed in the Makefile

  xpbwpoly.input was removed as it is now associated with
  its source domain and automatically generated.

  hyperbolicrules.input was added

  Tim Lahey submitted a fix for bugs in schaum17.input

  A cherry-picked patch from Fricas in 2007 was removed
  because it causes an algebra regression. The regression
  test file was corrected.

  fixed.input was converted to a regression test file


Build process

  The lsp/Makefile was updated for GCL pre3 patches

  An ubuntu64 chunk was added as a system target

  src/Makefile outputs util.ht before compiles (bug 7146)

  books/Makefile uses bash SHELL to fix echo behavior.
  The standard sh echo behaves badly.

  books/Makefile now has amssymb in preamble for toc.tex


GCL (zips)

  Axiom now includes GCL pre3, the latest snapshot of GCL.
  This can be chosen as an option for building in the top
  level Makefile.pamphlet

  The lsp/Makefile was updated for GCL pre3 patches

faq

  FAQ 49: How do I get the lastest GCL?

<pre>

Axiom website
   The effort here is to improve the support for offline literate
   documentation. The primary changes are the inclusion of graphs
   and additional book volumes.

* <http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/documentation.html>
  Contains the new algebra volumes and subvolumes.
* <http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/bookvol10.2abb.html>
  Contains a "clickable" graph that indexes into the algebra.




Graphviz, PDF, and HTML integration
   The effort here is to unify these three technologies in a way
   that simplifies the user interface and improves documentation

* Graphviz is used if available but not required
* Algebra graphs are automatically generated at build time
  from algebra source files
* Graphviz graphs now properly hyperlink into PDF files allowing
  any node in a graph to link to any document page




Book volume 0 (Jenks and Sutor)

* <http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/bookvol0.pdf>
* replace \over with \frac



Book volume 7.1 (Hyperdoc pages)
   The effort here is to create a literate document that contains
   all of the "live" pages used in hyperdoc. The PDF is being
   constructed so that a user can effectively "browse" the static
   hyperdoc pages, which are included, without a running Axiom.

* <http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/bookvol7.1.pdf>
* The source for all of the pages is now contained in this book.
* Hyperdoc now fetches the pages directly from the book.
* The hyper page directory and all files are gone.
* Some of the static page images are now inside the PDF
* Pages have href links allowing "in-pdf" navigation of pages




Book volume 10 (Algebra)
   The effort here is to create a way to describe and deeply
   document the algebra. This volume was split to better handle
   the structure of Axiom's information. 

* Split into 5 volumes
   - 10   Implementation
   - 10.1 Theory
   - 10.2 Categories
   - 10.3 Domains
   - 10.4 Packages




Book volume 10.2 (Algebra Categories)
   The effort here is to create fully indexed, cross-referenced,
   graphical documentation for Axiom categories in a standalone
   form. This is a "live" literate document which contains the 
   actual source code used to build the system.

* <http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/bookvol10.2.pdf>
* Contains 60 categories so far
* Has partial graphs for each category
* Has list of exported functions 
* Has information about source of functions
* Has index cross reference by function and category
* Has PDF href links so that URLs work:
   <http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/bookvol10.2.pdf#nameddest=AGG>
* Has forward/backward links between categories
* Automatically generates "clickable" graphs:
   <http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/bookvol10.2abb.html>
* Graph clicking automatically opens to the proper source code




New algebra examples (Daly, Tsikas)
   The effort here is to create "real time" documentation that
   gives the end user an example of how to construct the proper
   arguments and call a function. This puts examples into the
   system so users don't need to consult other documents.

* )d op someop shows examples of function usage
* about 100 new function examples were added 
* new comment syntax added to allow automatic API testing




Input Files
   There is a new effort to automatically extract the algebra
   examples in order to regression test the user API to the
   algebra. In addition there is ongoing test work.

* New input files (Hemmecke, Stumbo, Cyganski, Daly)
     bini, biquat, ifthenelse, liu, overload, sqrt3, typetower
* Changed input files (Hemmecke, Stumbo, Cyganski, Daly)
     bern, function, linalg, regset, test, tutchap2




Build changes

* graphics does not depend on compress, done at build time
* firefox html pages are now built before tests are run



Algebra changes

* FLAGG (FiniteLinearAggregate) -- removed a duplicate function



Interpreter changes (Page)

* add cost function to bottomUp output

The July 2008 release marks the second large-scale change toward a
literate Axiom distribution. The original change was to make every
file into a pamphlet document. This second change draws Axiom into
tighter collections, called books (for obvious reasons). 

There is a new "books" directory which contains 14 books, most of
which are new:

 bookvol0:  The reconstructed Jenks and Sutor book
 bookvol1:  The published tutorial volume
 bookvol2:  Users Guide
 bookvol3:  Programmers Guide
 bookvol4:  Developers Guide
 bookvol5:  Interpreter
 bookvol6:  Command
 bookvol7:  Hyperdoc
 bookvol7.1 Hyperdoc Pages
 bookvol8:  Graphics
 bookvol9:  Compiler
 bookvol10: Algebra
 bookvol11: Browser
 bookvol12: Crystal

All of these books now exist. Portions of the current system have
been moved completely into book form (Graphics and Hyperdoc) so
the old files have been removed from the src tree. Both Graphics
and Hyperdoc are now built directly from their book. Work will 
follow on other parts of the system.

These books are online at:
<http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/documentation.html>




There is an interesting side-effect of using literate technology.
Once you combine C and .h files into a single document so that each
file is a separate chunk it becomes obvious that there is no need for
local include files. The lines that read:
   #include "foo.h"
become
   <<foo.h>>
and get expanded inline. Once you do this it also becomes obvious
that many include files get included multiple times (a clear waste
of disk I/O and preparser time). Further it becomes clear that there
is no need for creating tiny .o files since all of the source can
be combined into one C file using chunks. 

These approaches were used to reduce the compile-time overhead
for both the graphics and the hyperdoc functions.




In addition to consolidating the source files for Graphics into
bookvol8 there were several other changes.

  * the functions for graphics, that is, viewman, view2d, view3d
    and viewalone are now built as single C files. 
  * the graphics code was reorganized into chapters of related code
  * there is the beginnings of documentation
  * there is the beginnings of a test suite based on the 
    CRC Handbook of Curves and Surfaces
  * the book is hyperlinked (Bill Page, Frederic Lehobey, Anatoly Raportirenko)
  * redundant code was eliminated
  * the code is fully indexed
  * the src/graph subdirectory is gone



In addition to consolidating the source files for Hyperdoc into
bookvol7 there were several other changes.

  * the functions for hyperdoc, that is, spadbuf, ex2ht, htadd, hthits
    and hypertex are now built as single C files
  * the hyperdoc code was reorganized into chapters of related code
  * there is the beginnngs of documentation
  * redundant code was eliminated
  * scroll wheel handling was added (Gregory Vanuxem)
  * the book is hyperlinked (Bill Page, Frederic Lehobey, Anatoly Raportirenko)
  * the code is fully indexed
  * )hd now works to start or restart Hyperdoc (Jose Alfredo Portes)
  * the src/hyper subdirectory is gone



In addition to consolidating the hyperdoc pages into bookvol7.1
there were several other changes:

  * the pages are hyperlinked
  * new latex macros were written to simplify page handling
  * images of hyperdoc pages were added
  * forward and backward hyperlinks between pages images works
    making it possible to "browse" the hyperdoc pages using only
    the single PDF file (Bill Page, Frederic Lehobey, Anatoly Raportirenko)
  * the pages are fully indexed
  * the src/hyper/pages subdirectory is gone



A combined table of contents PDF is now automatically generated
which covers all of the volumes. This makes it easier to find the
topic of interest.


In addition there were several other changes.

  * Some fixes were made for different platforms
       In particular, Fedora9 breaks the build and needs work

  * The configure script was replaced by instructions
       The standard (export AXIOM) works everywhere so the configure
       script is useless for guessing.

  * the FAQ was updated about git
       Since the May 2008 release the primary Gold source code platform
       is github. The FAQ was updated to reflect this.

  * the FAQ was updated about X11
       X11 has moved yet again so more notes are needed

  * move axbook to books
       The hyperlinked version of Jenks is now built from the books dir

  * add Ralf Hemmecke's documentation to ax.boot
  * add Monoid multiply to DirectProduct (Ralf Hemmecke)
  * add Monoid multiply regression test

COMPUTER ALGEBRA TEST SUITE

A large part of the effort for these two months has involved detailed
test cases of Axiom's integration routines against Schaum's Handbook
of Mathematical Formulas. Of the 619 integrals, the detailed results are:

419 Schaums and Axiom agree
137 No closed form solution
 60 Cannot simplify

  2 Typos found in Schaums
  1 Axiom bug

The Axiom bug was in src/algebra/intef.spad.pamphlet. There was a
fix applied to this code for a previously identified bug but the
previous fix was incorrect.

In addition, there were
 src/input/danzwill2.input.pamphlet added for the MIT Integration tests
 src/inputmapleok.input.pamphlet to fix typos
 src/input/kamke1.input.pamphlet had ode97 removed due to running time
 src/input/kamke2.input.pamphlet ode104, ode105 removed for running time

Axiom is now available at github, a git-based code repository.
This site will have the Gold version of Axiom, that is, only
code that changes at each two-month release. To get a clone type:

   git-clone git://github.com/daly/axiom.git


USER VISIBLE CHANGES

  One primary focus of this release has been extending the Firefox
  toward being a full Axiom user interface (as opposed to a simple
  hyperdoc replacement). The Firefox console page has new, AJAX
  based, dropdown menus which are planned to be dynamically updated
  to display available functions for the last computed type. This 
  should make it much easier to find the applicable functions by
  category and type. They are currently static in this release.

* Firefox Pages

 o Dropdown menus were added to the Axiom console page
 o More hyperdoc pages were translated to Firefox/html
 o Bitmaps and graphics are now properly handled in pages
 o A minor mathml fix was applied (for invisible times)

* Refcard

 o An Axiom reference card of Axiom commands was created (src/doc/refcard)

* Examples

 o It is often difficult to figure the exact arguments required to call
   any given function in Axiom. The )display operation command used to
   only show the available modemaps. This command has now been changed.
    )display operation foo
   now shows examples of function calls for foo.

* Help

 o The plot routines have new help files and documentation

PORTING

 o Axiom was ported to MAC-OSX

 o The binary download page now has binaries for 
   Ubuntu, OpenSUsE, Redhat9, Redhat72, Debian, MACOSX at 
    <http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/download.html>

 o Binaries for the this release will be available shortly.


INTERNALS

* Compiler changes
 o  hashtables were used to speed up compiles

* Algebra changes
 o  There are new special functions, Ei,En,Ei1,Ei2,Ei3,Ei4,Ei5,Ei6
 o  The prime and BasicSieve functions are faster
 o  The Brent/Pollard algorithm was documented
 o  Bad gcd reductions are checked (heugcd regression test file added)
 o  The plot routines have new help files and documentation

* Makefile changes
 o  Bi-capital SVN copies are no longer made

* Interpreter changes
 o  Book Volume 5 has new documentation on the display function
 o  The display function code has been translated and moved to book volume 5
 o  PI has a higher internal precision
 o  Mappings are now properly hashed for Aldor

CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite)

 o The differential equations regression tests are being checked against
   Mathematica, Maple, and Maxima. This has happended for the kamke2.input
   regression test file and will happen for the other regression tests.

o  Complex Gamma, logGamma, and log(Gamma) have additional tests and
   documentation.

There have been two major concentrations of effort in this release.

The first concentration is on the new Firefox Hyperdoc and the
second concentration was the verification of Axiom against
published standards.




Firefox Hyperdoc

The Firefox Hyperdoc has been integrated with the rest of the
interpreter. The new )browse command causes Axiom to listen and
serve hyperdoc pages on port 8085. 

The interpreter was changed to add the )browse command. As a 
side-effect new documentation was added to the interpreter
volume (bookvol5) to explain top-level command handling. In
addition, lisp and boot code was rewritten as part of the
literate change.

New sections were added to cover the beginning of the Computer
Algebra Test Suite (CATS) subsection which brings a focus on
compliance with published standards.

Arthur Ralf's mathml-enabled version of the Jenks book is fully
integrated into the Firefox Hyperdoc. Arthur also fixed some
rendering and ambiguity issues.

  axbook.tgz              fix the user/group settings
  axserver.spad           fix lastType output re: errors
  bookvol5                browse and top-level command handling 
  bookvol11               add standards compliance for gamma
  gammacomplexinverse.png added
  gammacomplex.png        added
  gammareal3.png          added
  loggamma.png            added
  mathml.spad             fix ambiguity bug in mathml output
  mathml.spad             fix hex(10) mathml rendering 
  mathml.spad             fix F,3 mathml rendering 
  mathml.spad             remove code to eat %% 
  psi.png                 added 




Standards Verification

The Computer Algebra Test Suite (CATS) effort checks the results
that Axiom generates against published results. Axiom has an
extensive set of regression tests (the KAMKE suite) for ordinary
differential equations, for integration (the SCHAUM suite), and
for numeric special functions (the ABRAMOWITZ suite). In addition,
results have been checked against Mathematica, Maple, and Maxima.

  asinatan.input   regression for the functions asin and atan
  asinhatanh.input regression for the functions asinh and atanh
  besselk.input    regression for the function besselK
  e1.input         regression for the function E1
  en.input         regression for the function En
  exp.input        regression for the function exp
  gamma.input      regression for the function gamma
  log.input        regression for the functions log
  pfaffian.input   regression for the function pfaffian
  seccsc.input     regression for the functions sec and csc
  sincos.input     regression for the functions sin and cos
  sinhcosh.input   regression for the functions sinh and cosh
  tancot.input     regression for the functions tan and cot
  tanhcoth.input   regression for the functions tanh and coth




New Functions Added

Axiom is missing various special functions found in other computer
algebra systems. This release adds two new ones, the Exponential
Integral E1 and the higher order Exponential Integral En.  These have
been tested against the published results.

  special.spad E1 added
  special.spad En added




Bugs Fixed

There are 15 bug fixes in this release:

  bug 7015: fix hex(10) mathml rendering
  bug 7016: remove code to eat %% 
  bug 7019: fix F,3 mathml rendering 
  bug 7023: discardGraph free corrected 
  bug 7042: ignore regression test gensym
  bug 7045: wrong Makefile for Xpm fix 
  bug 7052: spurious remake of axbook
  bug 7054: /home/silver path in bookvol11
  bug 7057: ambiguity in mathml
  bug 7089/343: FreeAbelianGroup order 
  bug 7090/355 handle besselK
  bug 7093: Function name fix
  bug 7100/149: numlock in hyperdoc
  bug 7101/204: MoreSystemCommand unnecessary loading 
  bug 7102/412: Equality testing in TableAggregate 




Regression test fixes

As changes happen in the system the regression tests are updated
to reflect the new conditions. Changing the category of PositiveInteger
caused (a + -bi) to print as (a - bi). New builds raised gensym faults
which were fixed. And new builds change random numbers so the tests
that depend on them are marked "ok" despite failures due to randomness.
The FreeAbelianGroup bug is tested.

  acplot.spad     fix output form of negative numbers
  calculus2.input fix function names 
  classtalk.input ignore gensyms
  collect.input   fix function names 
  dfloat.input    handle negative number output
  easter.input    fix function names 
  elemnum.input   handle negative number output
  exlap.input     fix function names 
  exsum.input     fix function names 
  free.input      added to test bug
  grpthry.input   mark random generation failures ok
  grpthry.input   fix function names 
  ico.input       mark random generation failures ok
  intg0.input     ignore gensyms
  is.input        type declare function
  kamke3.input    mark random generation failures ok
  knot2.input     fix function names 
  lodo.spad       ignore regression test gensym 
  mapleok.input   ignore gensyms
  mathml.input    handle new mathml sub/sup change
  ndftip.input    fix missing blank lines
  pmint.input     rewritten
  repa6.input     fix function names 
  r20bugs.input   change spacing
  sf.spad         fix output form of negative numbers
  tbagg.input     regression for equality testing in TableAggregate




Algebra file changes

The fundamental change was a supposedly transparent move of
the category for PositiveInteger. This had the effect of changing
the output form and broke several regression tests. Some mathml
issues were fixed. The new functions E1 and En were added. The
FreeAbelianGroup bug was fixed.

  axserver.spad  fix lastType output re: errors
  acplot.spad    fix output form of negative numbers
  combfunc.spad  fix bold font handling
  integer.spad   category change for PositiveInteger
  sf.spad fix    output form of negative numbers
  sf.spad        handle besselK
  op.spad        handle besselK 
  combfunc.spad  handle besselK 
  free.spad      fix FreeAbelianGroup bug 
  special.spad   add E1
  special.spad   add En
  mathml.spad    fix ambiguity bug in mathml output
  mathml.spad    fix hex(10) mathml rendering 
  mathml.spad    fix F,3 mathml rendering 
  mathml.spad    remove code to eat %% 



Interpreter changes

The primary changes are the addition of bookvol11 for the Firefox
Hyperdoc and the literate documentation of the top level command
handling in bookvol5 (the interpreter) along with rewrites of the
lisp/boot code.

  bootfuns.lisp move $systemCommands to bookvol5
  bookvol5      browse and top-level command handling
  bookvol11     added
  http.lisp     mathObject2String for hex(10) 
  incl.boot     move incBiteOff to bookvol5
  intint.lisp   move setCurrentLine to bookvol5
  int-top.boot  move ncloopCommand, etc. to bookvol5
  i-syscmd.boot move $SYSCOMMANDS to bookvol5
  Makefile      wrong Makefile for Xpm fix 
  makegraph.c   discardGraph free corrected 
  nci.lisp      move ncloopInclude to bookvol5
  setq.lisp     move command initialization to bookvol5



Documentation changes

  bookvol5      explain top level input handling (lisp/boot rewrite)
  combfunc.spad fix bold font handling
  axiom.sty     add binom

  The newton.spad file is actually part of the fffg.spad file so it
  was removed. The very top level spad functions in GUESS still do
  not work properly.

20070909 tpd src/algebra/newton.spad included in fffg.spad
20070909 tpd src/algebra/Makefile remove newton.spad (duplicate)


FIX BUILD PROCESS
  The build process was not properly suppressing output by default.

20070907 tpd src/algebra/acplot.spad fix PlaneAlgebraicCurvePlot.help NOISE
20070907 tpd src/algebra/Makefile make regression respect NOISE variable
20070907 tpd src/input/Makefile make regression respect NOISE variable


FIX INSTALL PROCESS
  The install process had a bug.

20070906 tpd Makefile int/sman/axiom command to target command for install
20070906 tpd src/sman/Makefile copy axiom command to int


ADD ALDOR RELEASE
  The aldor release has been added to zips. It will soon be part of
  the build mechanism but separately maintained like GCL.

20070901 tpd zips/aldor.20070901.tgz add pdf documentation
20070901 tpd zips/aldor.20070901.tgz added


ADD )HELP FACILITY
  The )help facility was recovered. The documentation is now integrated
  into the spad files and used both for help documentation and algebra
  regression testing.
