  <h1> Why Literate Programming?</h1>
</center>
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>To understand a program, be the machine.
To understand text, be human. 
Write for your audience.
Write Literate Programs.
<br/><br/>
--Tim Daly April, 2013
<br/>
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>In my life as an artchitect, I find that the single thing which inhibits
young professionals, new students most severely, is their acceptance of
standards that are too low. If I ask a student whether her design is as
good as Chartres, she often smiles tolerantly at me as if to say, "Of
course not, that isn't what I am trying to do...I could never do that."</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: "That standard must be 
our standard. If you are going to be a builder, no other standard is
worthwhile."</b>
<br/><br/>
--Christopher Alexander, May 1996 in (Patterns of Software, Gabriel)
<br/>
</blockquote>
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>The best programming language is English. Everything else is notation.</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
-- Timothy Daly (2011)
<br/><br/>
<a href="litprog.html">Here is an <b>example literate program</b> in HTML</a>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v46/i03/paper">
Here is a Journal article about Literate Programming and Reproducible
Research</a>
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation of
programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs to be
works of literature. Hence, my title "Literate Programming"</b>
<br/>
<b>
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do,
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a
computer to do.</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
-- Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1984)" in Literate Programming CSLI, p99
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>Step away from the machine. 
Literate programming has nothing to do with tools
or style. It has very little to do with programming.
One of the hard transitions to literate programming is "literate thinking".</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
-- Timothy Daly (2010) in Lambda the Ultimate forum [LTW10]
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>The hardest part of literate programming is the documentation.</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
--Timothy Daly (2011)
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>The effect of this simple shift of emphasis can be so profound as to change
one's whole approach to programming. Under the literate programming paradigm,
the central activity of programming becomes that of conveying meaning to 
other intelligent beings rather than merely convincing the computer to behave
in a particular way. It is the difference between performing and exposing
a magic trick.</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
--Ross Williams, FunnelWeb Tutorial Manual, pg 4.
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>Another thing I've been enjoying lately is literate programming.
Amazingly it turns out to be faster to write a literate program than
an ordinary program because debugging takes almost no time.</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
--Bill Hart, SAGE Mailing list, May 3, 2010
<br/><br/>

<blockquote>
<b>The conversation is much more direct if the Design Concept per se,
rather than derivative representatives or partial details, is the focus.</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
--Fred Brooks: The Design of Design: Essays from a Computer Scientist.
<br/><br/>

<blockquote>
<b>We are banning the old notion of literate programming that I used when
developing TeX82 because documentation has proven to be too much of a pain.</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
--Donald Knuth 
<a href="http://river-valley.tv/media/conferences/tug-2010/Don-Knuth-1">
TUG 2010</a>
<br/><br/>

And on Axiom's "30 Year Horizon" focus:<br/><br/>

<blockquote>
<b>Once upon a time I took great care to ensure that TeX82 would be
truly archival so that results obtainable today would produce the same
output 50 years from now but that was manifestly foolish. Let's face
it, who is going to care one whit for what I do today after even 5
years have elapsed, let alone 50. Life is too short to re-read
anything anymore in the internet age. Nothing over 30 months old is
trustworthy or interesting.
</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
--Donald Knuth

TUG 2010</a>
<br/><br/>

From a November, 2011 Knuth interview:
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>
<p>
Yet to me, literate programming is certainly the most important thing
that came out of the TeX project. Not only has it enabled me to write
and maintain programs faster and more reliably than ever before, and
been one of my greatest sources of joy since the 1980s -- it has
actually been indispensable at times. Some of my major programs, such
as the MMIX meta-simulator, could not have been written with any other
methodology that I've ever heard of. The complexity was simply too
daunting for my limited brain to handle; without literate programming,
the whole enterprise would have flopped miserably.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
If people discover nice ways to use the newfangled multithreaded
machines, I would expect the discovery to come from people who
routinely use literate programming. Literate programming is what you
need to rise above the ordinary level of achievement. But I don't
believe in forcing ideas on anybody. 
</p>

Interview with Donald Knuth</a>
<br/><br/>

<blockquote>
<p><b>
An abbot of the Seven-Clawed Blind Eagle Clan was tallying the
deliverables of the temple monks, when he noticed that a monk of the
Laughing Monkey Clan had produced no design documents.
</b></p>
<p><b>
"What if a problem were discovered in our production system?" the abbot
asked the monk. "How would the cause be understood by any besides
yourself?"
</b></p>
<p><b>
"The code itself should be examined," said the monk. "The Document is a
sickly beast, easily subject to the Three Plagues of Error: omission,
obfuscation, and obsolescence."
</b></p>
<p><b>
The abbot reported this to the Java master, who said: "Have the monk
balance on one foot with his staff outstretched, every day from dusk to
midnight. If he can say a word to please me I will revoke the punishment,
but not otherwise."
</b></p>
<p><b>
"Is there such a word?" asked the abbot.
</b></p>
<p><b>
"It is difficult to be certain," reflected the master. "Yesterday I was 
pleased by the sound of a cricket chirping after the first three drops
of rain. The day before, the plashing of milk in a pail returned me to
a pleasant memory of my youth. Perhaps the answer lies in the fragrance
of a white lotus that drifted once in a pond below my window."

The Codeless Code</a>
<br/><br/>

<hr/>
<br/>
Once a program has been developed and the developers have moved
on to other tasks it needs to be maintained. The fundamental problem
is that if you modify code you didn't write, you don't see the big
picture and you don't understand the reasons why the code is written
the way it is. Thus changing code without a larger context is almost
always going to introduce new bugs.
</p>
<p>
The only way to correctly change code is to deeply understand the
implications of the change. This requires a deep understanding of
the code and an awareness of the big picture. Yet the "why" of code
is rarely ever written down in standard programming practice.
The goal is only to elaborate the "how" so the machine can perform
the task. The programmer communicates with the machine.
</p>
<p>
Literate programming, as used in Axiom, is an attempt to communicate
with other users, developers, and researchers in addition to the
machine. The goal is to have the program read like a story so that
others can understand the rational, the theory, the choices, the
implications, and the implementation context as well as the "how".
</p>
<p>
This code is intended to live forever but it is highly probable
that you will not. Write to communicate with the next person to
pick up the torch. When you explore code, write down what you learn.
When you change code, explain why you made your choices. When you 
write new code explain what others need to know to maintain it.
</p>

  from the new hyperdoc show some of the details. These pages 
  will be "live" in the new Axiom hyperdoc.

  <p>
  <a name="buildorder"/>
  The <a href="hp.svg">Axiom build graph</a> shows the algebra
  hierarchy in required build order. Note that the edges in the
  graph only show dependence on the prior level in the hierarchy.
  There are approximate 1100 total nodes. Each node represents a
  single domain, category, or package. Graph nodes that are elliptical
  show objects that get build as part of the bootstrap process. 

  <p>
  The <a href="dotabb.html">algebra graph</a> in its current form is 
  available. You'll need a reasonably new browser to see the graph.
  This is a work in progress.

  <p> 
   The <a href="rosetta.html">Rosetta</a> 
   <a href="rosetta.tex">(src)</a> 
   <a href="rosetta.pdf">(pdf)</a> 
   document is a comparison of nearly equivalent commands between 
   many different computer algebra systems.
