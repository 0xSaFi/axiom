  <h1> Why Literate Programming?</h1>
</center>
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>I believe that the time is ripe for significantly better documentation of
programs, and that we can best achieve this by considering programs to be
works of literature. Hence, my title "Literate Programming"</b>
<br/>
<b>
Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs:
Instead of imaginging that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do,
let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a
computer to do.</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
-- Donald Knuth "Literate Programming (1984)" in Literate Programming CSLI, p99
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>The effect of this simple shift of emphasis can be so profound as to change
one's whole approach to programming. Under the literate programming paradigm,
the central activity of programming becomes that of conveying meaning to 
other intelligent beings rather than merely convincing the computer to behave
in a particular way. It is the difference between performing and exposing
a magic trick.</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
--Ross Williams, FunnelWeb Tutorial Manual, pg 4.
<br/><br/>
<blockquote>
<b>The conversation is much more direct if the Design Concept per se,
rather than derivative representatives or partial details is the focus.</b>
</blockquote>
<br/>
--Fred Brooks: The Design of Design: Essays from a Computer Scientist.

<br/>
Once a program has been developed and the developers have moved
on to other tasks it needs to be maintained. The fundamental problem
is that if you modify code you didn't write, you don't see the big
picture and you don't understand the reasons why the code is written
the way it is. Thus changing code without a larger context is almost
always going to introduce new bugs.
</p>
<p>
The only way to correctly change code is to deeply understand the
implications of the change. This requires a deep understanding of
the code and an awareness of the big picture. Yet the "why" of code
is rarely ever written down in standard programming practice.
The goal is only to elaborate the "how" so the machine can perform
the task. The programmer communicates with the machine.
</p>
<p>
Literate programming, as used in Axiom, is an attempt to communicate
with other users, developers, and researchers in addition to the
machine. The goal is to have the program read like a story so that
others can understand the rational, the theory, the choices, the
implications, and the implementation context as well as the "how".
</p>
<p>
This code is intended to live forever but it is highly probable
that you will not. Write to communicate with the next person to
pick up the torch. When you explore code, write down what you learn.
When you change code, explain why you made your choices. When you 
write new code explain what others need to know to maintain it.

  <h1> User documentation</h1>
<br/>

The Axiom system is gradually being documented in a set of volumes.
These change with every update to the system since they contain the
actual system source code. The volumes listed here are updated every
other month when the system is distributed. The current volume set is:
<ul>
 <li>
  <a href="toc.pdf">Combined Table of Contents</a>
 </li>
 This is the table of contents from the existing volumes
 combined into one document for easy reference.
 <br/>
 <li>
  <a href="bookvol0.pdf">Volume 0: Axiom Jenks and Sutor</a>
 </li>
 This is the reconstructed Jenks and Sutor volume.
 <br/>
 <li>
  <a href="bookvol1.pdf">Volume 1: Axiom Tutorial</a>
 </li>
 This is the tutorial volume ISBN 1-411-66587-X.
 Hardcopy is available from Amazon.com or Lulu.com
 <br/>

 <br/>
</ul>
  
  <p>
  Axiom is being reworked to use the Firefox browser as the new
  front end. <a href="hyperdoc/rootpage.xhtml">Static pages</a>
  from the new hyperdoc show some of the details. These pages 
  will be "live" in the new Axiom hyperdoc.

  <p>
  <a name="buildorder"/>
  The <a href="hp.svg">Axiom build graph</a> shows the algebra
  hierarchy in required build order. Note that the edges in the
  graph only show dependence on the prior level in the hierarchy.
  There are approximate 1100 total nodes. Each node represents a
  single domain, category, or package. Graph nodes that are elliptical
  show objects that get build as part of the bootstrap process. 

  <p>
  The <a href="dotabb.html">algebra graph</a> in its current form is 
  available. You'll need a reasonably new browser to see the graph.
  This is a work in progress.
