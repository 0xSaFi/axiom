Dynamic evaluation is a technique for producing multiple results
according to a decision tree which evolves with program execution.
Sometimes it is desired to produce results for all possible branches
in the decision tree, while on other occasions, it may be sufficient
to compute a single result which satisfies certain properties. This
techinique finds use in computer algebra where computing the correct
result depends on recognizing and properly handling special cases of
parameters. In previous work, programs using dynamic evaluation have
explored all branches of decision trees by repeating the computations
prior to decision points.

This paper presents two new implementations of dynamic evaluation
which avoid recomputing intermediate results. The first approach uses
Scheme ``continuations'' to record state for resuming program
execution. The second implementation uses the Unix ``fork'' operation
to form new processes to explore alternative branches in parallel.

\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
A number of recent programming language designs incorporate a type
checking system based on the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic
$\lambda$-calculus.  This allows the construction of general purpose,
reusable software without sacrificing compile-time type checking. A
major factor constraining the implementation of these languages is the
difficulty of automatically inferring the lengthy type information
that is otherwise required if full use is made of these
languages. There is no known algorithm to solve any natural and fully
general formulation of the ``type inference'' problem. One very
reasonable formulation of the problem is known to be undecidable.

Here we define a restricted version of the type inference problem and
present an efficient algorithm for its solution. We argue that the
restriction is sufficiently weak to be unobtrusive in practice.

We introduce control engineering as a new domain of application for

the role played by diagrammatic evaluation criteria involving numeric
plots of a design, such as Nichols and Bode plots. We show that
symbolic computation and computational logic can be used to discharge
these criteria and provide symbolic, automated, and very general
alternatives to these standard numeric tests. We illustrate our work
with reference to a standard reference model drawn from military
avionics.

Axiom is a very powerful computer algebra system which combines two
language paradigms (functional and OOP). Mathematical world is complex
and mathematicians use abstraction to design it. This paper presents
some aspects of the object oriented development in Axiom. The Axiom
programming is based on several new tools for object oriented
development, it uses two levels of class and some operations such that
{\sl coerce}, {\sl retract}, or {\sl convert} which permit the type
evolution. These notions introduce the concept of multi-view.

A major subproblem for algorithms that either factor ordinary linear
differential equations or compute their closed form solutions is to
find their solutions $y$ which satisfy $y^{'}/y \in \overline{K}(x)$
where $K$ is the constant field for the coefficients of the equation.
While a decision procedure for this subproblem was known in the
$19^{th}$ century, it requires factoring polynomials over
$\overline{K}$ and has not been implemented in full generality. We
present here an efficient algorithm for this subproblem, which has
been implemented in the AXIOM computer algebra system for equations of
arbitrary order over arbitrary fields of characteristic 0. This
algorithm never needs to compute with the individual complex
singularities of the equation, and algebraic numbers are added only
when they appear in the potential solutions.  Implementation of the
complete Singer algorithm for $n=2,3$ based on this building block is
in progress.

to operators with coefficients in arbitrary integral domains and
become faster than the traditional methods for symmetric powers of
sufficiently large order, or over sufficiently complicated coefficient
domains. The basic ideas are also applicable to other computations
involving cyclic vector techniques, such as exterior powers of
differential or difference operators.

The main new concept we wish to illustrate in this paper is a
distinction between ``domains of data'' and ``domains of terms'', and
its use in the programming of certain mathematical structures.
Although this distinction is implicit in much of the programming work
that has gone into the construction of Axiom categories and domains,
we believe that a formalisation of this is new, that standards and
conventions are necessary and will be useful in various other
contexts. We shall show how this concept may be used for the coding of
free categories and groupoids on directed graphs.

It is well-known that few object-oriented programming languages allow
objects to change their nature at run-time. There have been a number
of reasons presented for this, but it appears that there is a real
need for matters to change. In this paper we discuss the need for
object-oriented programming languages to reflect the dynamic nature of
problems, particularly those arising in a mathematical context. It is
from this context that we present a framework that realistically
represents the dynamic and evolving characteristic of problems and
algorithms.

This paper explains how Scratchpad solves the problem of presenting a
categorical view of factorization in unique factorization domains, i.e.
a view which can be propagated by functors such as SparseUnivariatePolynomial
or Fraction. This is not easy, as the constructive version of the classical
concept of UniqueFactorizationDomain cannot be so propagated. The solution
adopted is based largely on Seidenberg's conditions (F) and (P), but there
are several additional points that have to be borne in mind to produce
reasonably efficient algorithms in the required generality.

The consequence of the algorithms and interfaces presented in this
paper is that Scratchpad can factorize in any extension of the
integers or finite fields by any combination of polynomial, fraction
and algebraic extensions: a capability far more general than any other
computer algebra system possesses. The solution is not perfect: for
example we cannot use these general constructions to factorize
polyinmoals in $\overline{Z[\sqrt{-5}]}[x]$ since the domain
$Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a unique factorization domain, even though
$\overline{Z[\sqrt{-5}]}$ is, since it is a field. Of course, we can
factor polynomials in $\overline{Z}[\sqrt{-5}][x]$

Computer algebra systems have to deal with the confusion between
``programming variables'' and ``mathematical symbols''. We claim that
they should also deal with ``unknowns'', i.e. elements whose values
are unknown, but whose type is known. For examples $x^p \ne x$ if $x$
is a symbol, but $x^p = x$ if $x \in GF(p)$. We show how we have
extended Axiom to deal with this concept.

\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
Computer algebra systems are large collections of routines for solving
mathematical problems algorithmically, efficiently and above all,
symbolically. The more advanced and rigorous computer algebra systems
(for example, Axiom) use the concept of strong types based on
order-sorted algebra and category theory to ensure that operations are
only applied to expressions when they ``make sense''.

In cases where Axiom uses notions which are not covered by current
mathematics we shall present new mathematics which will allow us to
prove that all such cases are reducible to cases covered by the
current theory. On the other hand, we shall also point out all the
cases where Axiom deviates undesirably from the mathematical ideal.
Furthermore we shall propose solutions to these deviations.

Strongly typed systems (especially of mathematics) become unusable
unless the system can change the type in a way a user expects. We wish
any change expected by a user to be automated, ``natural'', and
unique. ``Coercions'' are normally viewed as ``natural type changing
maps''. This thesis shall rigorously define the word ``coercion'' in
the context of computer algebra systems.

We shall list some assumptions so that we may prove new results so
that all coercions are unique. This concept is called ``coherence''.

We shall give an algorithm for automatically creating all coercions in
type system which adheres to a set of assumptions. We shall prove that
this is an algorithm and that it always returns a coercion when one
exists. Finally, we present a demonstration implementation of this
automated coerion algorithm in Axiom.

In this paper the analysis of the data structures used in a symbolic
computation system, called Kenzo, is undertaken. We deal with the
specification of the inheritance relationship since Kenzo is an
object-oriented system, written in CLOS, the Common Lisp Object
System. We focus on a particular case, namely the relationship between
simplicial sets and chain complexes, showing how the order-sorted
algebraic specifications formalisms can be adapted, through the
``inheritance as coercion'' metaphor, in order to model this Kenzo
fragment.

Some of the earliest computer algebra systems (CAS) looked like
overloaded languages of the same era. FORMAC, PL/I FORMAC, Formula
Algol, and others each took advantage of a pre-existing language base
and expanded the notion of a numeric value to include mathematical
expressions. Much more recently, perhaps encouraged by the growth in
popularity of C++, we have seen a renewal of the use of overloading to
implement a CAS.

This paper makes three points. 1. It is easy to do overloading in
Common Lisp, and show how to do it in detail. 2. Overloading per se
provides an easy solution to some simple programming problems. We show
how it can be used for a ``demonstration'' CAS. Other simple and
plausible overloadings interact nicely with this basic system. 3. Not
all goes so smoothly: we can view overloading as a case study and
perhaps an object lesson since it fails to solve a number of
fairly-well articulated and difficult design issues in CAS for which
other approaches are preferable.

One of the main strengths of computer algebra is being able to solve a
family of problems with one computation. In order to express not only
one problem but a family of problems, one introduces some symbols
which are in fact the parameters common to all the problems of the
family.

The user must be able to understand in which way these parameters
affect the result when he looks at the answer. Otherwise it may lead
to completely wrong calculations, which when used for numerical
applications bring nonsensical answers. This is the case in most
current Computer Algebra Systems we know because the form of the
answer is never explicitly conditioned by the values of the
parameters. The user is not even informed that the given answer may be
wrong in some cases then computer algebra systems can not be entirely
trustworthy. We have introduced multi-valued expressions called {\sl
conditional} expressions, in which each potential value is associated
with a condition on some parameters. This is used, in particular, to
capture the situation in integration, where the form of the answer can
depend on whether certain quantities are positive, negative or
zero. We show that it is also necessary when solving modular linear
equations or deducing congruence conditions from complex expressions.

Buchberger's algorithm calculates Groebner bases of polynomial
ideals. Its efficiency depends strongly on practical criteria for
detecting superfluous reductions. Buchberger recommends two
criteria. The more important one is interpreted in this paper as a
criterion for detecting redundant elements in a basis of a module of
syzygies. We present a method for obtaining a reduced, nearly minimal
basis of that module. The simple procedure for detecting (redundant
syzygies and )superfluous reductions is incorporated now in our
installation of Buchberger's algorithm in SCRATCHPAD II and REDUCE
3.3. The paper concludes with statistics stressing the good
computational properties of these installations.

We present hidden verification as a means to make the power of
computational logic available to users of computer algebra systems
while shielding them from its complexity. We have implemented in PVS a
library of facts about elementary and transcendental function, and
automatic procedures to attempt proofs of continuity, convergence and
differentiability for functions in this class. These are called
directly from Maple by a simple pipe-lined interface. Hence we are
able to support the analysis of differential equations in Maple by
direct calls to PVS for: result refinement and verification, discharge
of verification conditions, harnesses to ensure more reliable
differential equation solvers, and verifiable look-up tables.

This thesis presents an algorithm for computing (one-sided) limits
within a symbolic manipulation system. Computing limtis is an
important facility, as limits are used both by other functions such as
the definite integrator and to get directly some qualitative
information about a given function.

The algorithm we present is very compact, easy to understand and easy
to implement. It overcomes the cancellation problem other algorithms
suffer from. These goals were achieved using a uniform method, namely
by expanding the whole function into a series in terms of its most
rapidly varying subexpression instead of a recursive bottom up
expansion of the function. In the latter approach exact error terms
have to be kept with each approximation in order to resolve the
cancellation problem, and this may lead to an intermediate expression
swell. Our algorithm avoids this problem and is thus suited to be
implemented in a symbolic manipulation system.

provided. Facilities for computation include symbolic integration,
differentiation, factorization, solution of equations and linear
algebra.  Code economy and modularity is achieved by having
polymorphic packages of functions that may create datatypes. The use
of categories makes these facilities as general as possible.

A new method is proposed for finding the logarithmic part of an

and is easy to implement. It does not have the feature of finding a
closed form of an integral whenever there is one. But it very often
does, as we will show by a comparison with the built-in integrators of
some computer algebra systems.

and (iii) interface specifications which assist the verification of
pre- and post conditions of implemented code.

One way in which mathematicians deal with infinite amounts of data is
symbolic representation. A simple example is the quadratic equation
\[x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]
a formula which uses symbolic representation to describe the solutions
to an infinite class of equations. Most computer algebra systems can
deal with polynomials with symbolic coefficients, but what if symbolic
exponents are called for (e.g. $1+t^i$)? What if symbolic limits on
summations are also called for, for example
\[1+t+\ldots+t^i=\sum_j{t^j}\]
The ``Scratchpad Concept'' is a theoretical ideal which allows the
implementation of objects at this level of abstraction and beyond in a
mathematically consistent way. The Axiom computer algebra system is an
implementation of a major part of the Scratchpad Concept.  Axiom
(formerly called Scratchpad) is a language with extensible
parameterized types and generic operators which is based on the
notions of domains and categories. By examining some aspects of the
Axiom system, the Scratchpad Concept will be illustrated. It will be
shown how some complex problems in homologicial algebra were solved
through the use of this system.

The Axiom language is based on the notions of ``categories'',

interface between symbolic and numeric calculations. In particular, an
interface to the NAG Fortran Library and Axiom's algebra and graphics
facilities is presented. Some examples of numerical calculations in a
symbolic computational environment are also included using the finite
element method. While the examples are elementary, we believe that
they point to very powerful methods for combining numeric and symbolic
computational techniques.

This paper investigates some soundness conditions which have to be
fulfilled in systems with coercions and generic operators. A result of
Reynolds on unrestricted generic operators is extended to generic
operators which obey certain constraints. We get natural conditions
for such operators, which are expressed within the theoretic framework
of category theory. However, in the context of computer algebra, there
arise examples of coercions and generic operators which do not fulfil
these conditions. We describe a framework -- relaxing the above
conditions -- that allows distinguishing between cases of ambiguities
which can be resolved in a quite natural sense and those which
cannot. An algorithm is presented that detects such unresolvable
ambiguities in expressions.

The Macsyma system arose out of research on mathematical software in

integration and simplification arose out of the interest of people,
such as the author, who were also mathematics students. The later
development of algorithms for the GCD of sparse polynomials, for
example, arose out of the needs of our user community. During various
times in the 1970's the computer on which Macsyma ran was one of the
most popular notes on the ARPANET. We discuss the attempts in the late
70's and the 80's to develop Macsyma systems that ran on popular
computer architectures.  Finally, we discuss the impact of the
fundamental ideas in Macsyma on current research on large scale
engineering systems.

OpenMath is a widely recognized approach to the semantic markup of
mathematics that is often used for communication between OpenMath
compliant systems. The Aldor language has a sophisticated
category-based type system that was specifically developed for the
purpose of modelling mathematical structures, while the system itself
supports the creation of small-footprint applications suitable for
deployment as web services. In this paper we present our first results
of how one may perform translations from generic OpenMath objects into
values in specific Aldor domains, describing how the Aldor interfae
domain ExpresstionTree is used to achieve this. We outline our Aldor
implementation of an OpenMath translator, and describe an efficient
extention of this to the Parser category. In addition, the Aldor
service creation and invocation mechanism are explained. Thus we are
in a position to develop and deploy mathematical web services whose
descriptions may be directly derived from Aldor's rich type language.

An Axiom front end is described, which is used to generate
mathematical objects needed by one of the latest NAG routines, to be
included in the Mark 17 version of the NAG Numerical library. This
routine uses powerful techniques to find the solution to Hyperbolic
Partial Differential Equations in conservation form and in one spatial
dimension. These mathematical objects are non-trivial, requiring much
mathematical knowledge on the part of the user, which is otherwise
irrelvant to the physical problem which is to be solved. We discuss
the individual mathematical objects, considering the mathematical
theory which is relevant, and some of the problems which have been
encountered and solved during the FORTRAN generation necessary to
realise the object.  Finally we display some of our results.

The normal claim for mathematics is that all calculations are 100\%
accurate and therefore one calculation can rely completely on the
results of sub-calculations, hoever there exist {\sl Monte-Carlo}
algorithms which are often much faster than the equivalent
deterministic ones where the results will have a prescribed
probability (presumably small) of being incorrect. However there has
been little discussion of how such algorithms can be used as building
blocks in Computer Algebra.  In this paper we describe how the
computational category theory which is the basis of the type structure
used in the Axiom computer algebra system may be extended to cover
probabilistic algorithms, which use Monte-Carlo techniques. We follow
this with a specific example which uses Straight Line Program
representation.

This paper presents a new encoding scheme for real algebraic number
manipulations which enhances current Axiom's real closure. Algebraic
manipulations are performed using different instantiations of
sub-resultant-like algorithms instead of Euclidean-like algorithms.
We use these algorithms to compute polynomial gcds and Bezout
relations, to compute the roots and the signs of algebraic
numbers. This allows us to work in the ring of real algebraic integers
instead of the field of read algebraic numbers avoiding many denominators.

If I were demonstrating Axiom and were asked this question, my reply
would be ``No, but I am not sure that this is a bad thing''. And I
would illustrate this with the following example.

Consider the following system of O.D.E.'s
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
\frac{dx_1}{dt} & = & \left(1+\frac{cos t}{2+sin t}\right)x_1\\
\frac{dx_2}{dt} & = & x_1 - x_2

This is a very simple system: $x_1$ is actually uncoupled from $x_2$

Real algebraic numbers appear in many Computer Algebra problems.  For
instance the determination of a cylindrical algebraic decomposition
for an euclidean space requires computing with real algebraic numbers.
This paper describes an implementation for computations with the real
roots of a polynomial. This process is designed to be recursively
used, so the resulting domain of computation is the set of all real
algebraic numbers. An implementation for the real algebraic closure
has been done in Axiom (previously called Scratchpad).

An introduction to the formal theory of partial differential equations
is given emphasizing the properties of involutive symbols and
equations.  An algorithm to complete any differential equation to an
involutive one is presented. For an involutive equation possible
values for the number of arbitrary functions in its general solution
are determined. The existence and uniqueness of solutions for analytic
equations is proven.  Applications of these results include an
analysis of symmetry and reduction methods and a study of gauge
systems. It is show that the Dirac algorithm for systems with
constraints is closely related to the completion of the equation of
motion to an involutive equation. Specific examples treated comprise
the Yang-Mills Equations, Einstein Equations, complete and Jacobian
systems, and some special models in two and three dimensions. To
facilitate the involved tedious computations an environment for
geometric approaches to differential equations has been developed in
the computer algebra system Axiom. The appendices contain among others
brief introductions into Carten-K\"ahler Theory and Janet-Riquier Theory.

We present a theoretical foundation for studying parametric systesm of
linear equations and prove an efficient algorithm for identifying all
parametric values (including degnerate cases) for which the system is
consistent. The algorithm gives a small set of regimes where for each
regime, the solutions of the specialized systems may be given
uniformly. For homogeneous linear systems, or for systems were the
right hand side is arbitrary, this small set is irredunant. We discuss
in detail practical issues concerning implementations, with particular
emphasis on simplification of results. Examples are given based on a
close implementation of the algorithm in SCRATCHPAD II. We also give a
complexity analysis of the Gaussian elimination method and compare
that with our algorithm.

The Scratchpad II system is an abstract datatype programming language,

that provides sophisticated type inference and coercion facilities.
Although originally designed for the implementation of symbolic
mathematical algorithms, Scratchpad II is a general purpose
programming language. This paper discusses aspects of the
implementation of the intepreter and how it attempts to provide a user
friendly and relatively weakly typed front end for the strongly typed
programming language.

is used to provide an axiomatisation of a number of familiar Aldor

Algorithms for computing integral bases of an algebraic function field
are implemented in some computer algebra systems. They are used e.g.
for the integration of algebraic functions. The method used by Maple
5.2 and AXIOM is given by Trager in [Trag84]. He adapted an algorithm
of Ford and Zassenhaus [Ford, 1978], that computes the ring of
integers in an algebraic number field, to the case of a function field.

It turns out that using algebraic geometry one can write a faster
algorithm. The method we will give is based on Puiseux expansions.
One cas see this as a variant on the Coates' algorithm as it is
described in [Davenport, 1981]. Some difficulties in computing with
Puiseux expansions can be avoided using a sharp bound for the number
of terms required which will be given in Section 3. In Section 5 we
derive which denominator is needed in the integral basis. Using this
result 'intermediate expression swell' can be avoided.

The Puiseux expansions generally introduce algebraic extensions. These
extensions will not appear in the resulting integral basis.

An important feature of modern computer algebra systems is the support
of a rich type system with the possibility of type inference. Basic
features of such a type system are polymorphism and coercion between
types. Recently the use of order-sorted rewrite systems was proposed
as a general framework. We will give a quite simple example of a
family of types arising in computer algebra whose coercion relations
cannot be captured by a finite set of first-order rewrite rules.

Most existing computer algebra systems are pure symbol manipulating
systems without language support for the occuring types. This is
mainly due to the fact taht the occurring types are much more
complicated than in traditional programming languages. In the last
decade the study of type systems has become an active area of
research. We will give a proposal for a type system showing that
several problems for a type system of a symbolic computation system
can be solved by using results of this research. We will also provide
a variety of examples which will show some of the problems that remain
and that will require further research.

We study type systems for computer algebra systems, which frequently
correspond to the ``pragmatically developed'' typing constructs used
in AXIOM.  A central concept is that of {\sl type classes} which
correspond to AXIOM categories. We will show that types can be
syntactically described as terms of a regular order-sorted signature
if no type parameters are allowed. Using results obtained for the
functional programming language Haskell we will show that the problem
of {\sl type inference} is decidable. This result still holds if
higher-order functions are present and {\sl parametric polymorphism}
is used. These additional typing constructs are useful for further
extensions of existing computer algebra systems: These typing concepts
can be used to implement category theoretic constructs and there are
many well known constructive interactions between category theory and
algebra.  \end{adjustwidth}

This paper presents algorithms that perform a type inference for a
type system occurring in the context of computer algebra. The type
system permits various classes of coercions between types and the
algorithms are complete for the precisely defined system, which can be
seen as a formal description of an important subset of the type system
supported by the computer algebra program Axiom.

Previously only algorithms for much more restricted cases of coercions
have been described or the frameworks used have been so general that
the corresponding type inference problems were known to be
undecidable.

Modern computer algebra systems (e.g. AXIOM) support a rich type
system including parameterized data types and the possibility of
implicit coercions between types. In such a type system it will be
frequently the case that there are different ways of building
coercions between types. An important requirement is that all
coercions between two types coincide, a property which is called {\sl
coherence}. We will prove a coherence theorem for a formal type system
having several possibilities of coercions covering many important
examples. Moreover, we will give some informal reasoning why the
formally defined restrictions can be satisfied by an actual system.

We give solutions to two problems of elementary algebra and geometry:
(1) find conditions on real numbers $p$, $q$, and $r$ so that the
polynomial function $f(x)=x^4+px^2+qx+r$ is nonnegative for all real
$x$ and (2) find conditions on real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ so that
the ellipse $\frac{(x-e)^2}{q^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}-1=0$ lies inside the
unit circle $y^2+x^2-1=0$. Our solutions are obtained by following the
basic outline of the method of quantifier elimination by cylindrical
algebraic decomposition (Collins, 1975), but we have developed, and
have been considerably aided by, modified versions of certain of its
steps. We have found three equally simple but not obviously equivalent
solutions for the first problem, illustrating the difficulty of
obtaining unique ``simplest'' solutions to quantifier elimination
problems of elementary algebra and geometry.

We present a new rational algorithm for solving Risch differential
equations in towers of transcendental elementary extensions. In
contrast to a recent algorithm by Davenport we do not require a
progressive reduction of the denominators involved, but use weak
normality to obtain a formula for the denominator of a possible
solution. Implementation timings show this approach to be faster than
a Hermite-like reduction.

The Hermite reduction is a symbolic integration technique that reduces
algebraic functions to integrands having only simple affine
poles. While it is very effective in the case of simple radical
extensions, its use in more general algebraic extensions requires the
precomputation of an integral basis, which makes the reduction
impractical for either multiple algebraic extensions or complicated
ground fields. In this paper, we show that the Hermite reduction can
be performed without {\sl a priori} computation of either a primitive
element or integral basis, computing the smallest order necessary for
a particular integrand along the way.

The CAD-based quantifier elimination algorithm takes a formula from
the elementary theory of real closed fields as input, and constructs a
CAD of the space of the formula's unquantified variables. This
decomposition is truth invariant with respect to the input formula,
meaning that the formula is either identically true or identically
false in each cell of the decomposition. The method determines the
truth of the input formula for each cell of the CAD, and then uses the
CAD to construct a solution formula -- a quantifier free formula that
is equivalent to the input formula. This final phase of the algorithm,
the solution formula construction phase, is the focus of this thesis.

An optimal solution formula construction algorithm would be {\sl
complete} -- i.e. applicable to any truth-invariant CAD, would be {\sl
efficient}, and would produce {\sl simple} solution formulas. Prior to
this thesis, no method was available with even two of these three
properties. Several algorithms are presented, all addressing problems
related to solution formula construction. In combination, these
provide an efficient and complete method for constructing solution
formulas that are simple in a variety of ways.

Algorithms presented in this thesis have been implemented using the
SACLIB library, and integrated into QEPCAD, a SACLIB-based
implementation of quantifier elimination by CAD. Example computations
based on these implementations are discussed.

This report introduces QEPCAD B, a program for computing with real
algebraic sets using cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD). QEPCAD
B both extends and improves upon the QEPCAD system for quantifier
elimination by partial cylindrical algebraic decomposition written by
Hoon Hong in the early 1990s. This paper briefly discusses some of the
improvements in the implementation of CAD and quantifier elimination
vis CAD, and provides somewhat more detail on extensions to the system
that go beyond quantifier elimination. The author is responsible for
most of the extended features of QEPCAD B, but improvements to the
basic CAD implementation and to the SACLIB library on which QEPCAD is
based are the results of many people's work.

One principle of structured programming is that a program should be
separated into meaningful independent subprograms, which are then
combined so that the relation of the parts to the whole can be clearly
established.  This paper describes several alternative ways to compose
programs. The main method used is to permit the programmer to denote
by an expression the sequence of values taken on by a variable. The
sequence is represented by a function called a stream, which is a
functional analog of a coroutine. The conventional while and for loops
of structured programming may be composed by a technique of stream
processing (analogous to list processing), which results in more
structured programs than the orignals. This technique makes it
possible to structure a program in a natural way into its logically
separate parts, which can then be considered independently.

The aim of this paper is to present how the dynamic evaluation method
can be used to deal with the real closure of an ordered field. Two
kinds of questions, or tests, may be asked in an ordered field:
equality tests $(a=b?)$ and sign tests $(a > b?)$. Equality tests are
handled through splittings, exactly as in the algebraic closure of a
field. Sign tests are handled throug a structure called ``Tarski data
type''.

We define a categorical framework, based on the notion of {\sl

specifications and algebraic programming. This framework goes far
beyond our initial motivations, which was to specify computation with
algebraic numbers. We begin by redefining sketches in order to deal
explicitly with programs. Expressions and terms are carefully defined
and studied, then {\sl quasi-projective sketches} are introduced. We
describe {\sl static evaluation} in these sketches: we propose a
rigorous basis for evaluation in the corresponding structures. These
structures admit an initial model, but are not necessarily
equational. In Part II (Duval and Reynaud 1994), we study a more
general process, called {\sl dynamic evaluation}, for structures that
may have no initial model.

We know we can solve this problem: Given any rational function
$f(x)=p(x)/q(x)$, where $p$ and $q$ are univariate polynomials over
the rationals, compute its {\sl indefinite} integral, using if
necessary, algebraic numbers. But in many circumstances an approximate
result is more likely to be of use. Furthermore, it is plausible that
it would be more useful to solve the problem to allow definite
integration, or introduce additional parameters so that we can solve
multiple definite integrations.  How can a computer algebra system
best answer the more useful questions?  Finally, what if the integrand
is not a ratio of polynomials, but something more challenging?

Computer algebra systems of the new generation, like Scratchpad, are
characterized by a very rich type concept, which models the
relationship between mathematical domains of computation. To use these
systems interactively, however, the user should be freed of type
information. A type inference mechanism determines the appropriate
function to call. All known models which allow to define a semantics
for type inference cannot express the rich ``mathematical'' type
structure, so presently type inference is done heuristically.  The
following paper defines a semantics for a subproblem thereof, namely
coercion, which is based on rewrite rules. From this definition, and
efficient coercion algorith for Scratchpad is constructed using graph
techniques.

An efficient probabilistic algorithm to find a normal basis in a
finite field is presented. It can, in fact, find an element of
arbitrary prescribed additive order. It is based on a density estimate
for normal elements. A similar estimate yields a probabilistic
polynomial-time reduction from finding primitive normal elements to
finding primitive elements.

\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
The automatic computation of limits can be reduced to two main
sub-problems. The first one is asymptotic comparison where one must
decide automatically which one of two functions in a specified class
dominates the other one asymptotically. The second one is asymptotic
cancellation and is usually exemplified by
\[e^x[exp(1/x+e^{-x})-exp(1/x)],\quad{}x \leftarrow \infty\]

In this example, if the sum is expanded in powers of $1/x$, the
expansion always yields $O(x^{-k})$, and this is not enough to
conclude.

In 1990, J.Shackell found an algorithm that solved both these problems
for the case of $exp-log$ functions, i.e. functions build by recursive
application of exponential, logarithm, algebraic extension and field
operations to one variable and the rational numbers. D. Gruntz and
G. Gonnet propose a slightly different algorithm for exp-log
functions.  Extensions to larger classes of functions are also
discussed.

\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
This paper proposes a fast algorithm for computing multiplicative
inverses in $GF(2^m)$ using normal bases. Normal bases have the
following useful property: In the case that an element $x$ in
$GF(2^m)$ is represented by normal bases, $2^k$ power operation of an
element $x$ in $GF(2^m)$ can be carried out by $k$ times cyclic shift
of its vector representation.  C.C. Wang et al. proposed an algorithm
for computing multiplicative inverses using normal bases, which
requires $(m-2)$ multiplications in $GF(2^m)$ and $(m-1)$ cyclic
shifts. The fast algorithm proposed in this paper also uses normal
bases, and computes multiplicative inverses iterating multiplications
in $GF(2^m)$. It requires at most $2[log_2(m-1)]$ multiplications in
$GF(2^m)$ and $(m-1)$ cyclic shifts, which are much less than those
required in Wang's method. The same idea of the proposed fast
algorithm is applicable to the general power operation in $GF(2^m)$
and the computation of multiplicative inverses in $GF(q^m)$ $(q=2^n)$.

A new formula is given for the logarithmic part of the integral of a
rational function, one that strongly improves previous algorithms and
does not need any computation in an algebraic extension of the field
of constants, nor any factorisation since only polynomial arithmetic
and GCD computations are used. This formula was independently found
and implemented in SCRATCHPAD by B.M. Trager.

We describe the development of a repository of mathematical knowledge
based on transformation rules. The specific mathematical problem is
indefinite integration. It is important that the repository be not
confused with a look-up table. The database of transformation rules is
at present encoded in Mathematica, but this is only one convenient
form of the repository, and it could be readily translated into other
formats. The principles upon which the set of rules is compiled is
described. One important principle is minimality. The benefits of the
approach are illustrated with examples, and with the results of
comparisons with other approaches.

\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
Bracket coefficients for polynomials are introduced. These are like
specific precision floating point numbers together with error
terms. Working in terms of bracket coefficients, an algorithm that
computes a Gr\"obner basis with floating point coefficients is
presented, and a new criterion for determining whether a bracket
coefficient is zero is proposed. Given a finite set $F$ of polynomials
with real coefficients, let $G_\mu$ be the result of the algorithm for
$F$ and a precision $\mu$, and $G$ be a true Gr\"obner basis of
$F$. Then, as $\mu$ approaches infinity, $G_\mu$ converges to $G$
coefficientwise. Moreover, there is a precision $M$ such that if 
$\mu \ge M$, then the sets of monomials with non-zero coefficients of
$G_\mu$ and $G$ are exactly the same. The practical usefulness of the
algorithm is suggested by experimental results.

A normal basis represention in $GF(2^n)$ allows squaring to be

in $GF(2^n)$ using a normal basis, and how they can be speeded up by
using parallelization, are investigated.

This paper presents an optimized method for factoring multivariate
polynomials over algebraic extension fields which defined by an
irreducible ascending set. The basic idea is to convert multivariate
polynomials to univariate polynomials and algebraic extensions fields
to algebraic number fields by suitable integer substitutions, then
factorize the univariate polynomials over the algebraic number fields.
Finally, construct multivariate factors of the original polynomial by
Hensel lemma and TRUEFACTOR test. Some examples with timing are
included.

In this paper we consider deterministic computation of the exact
determinant of a dense matrix $M$ of integers. We present a new
algorithm with worst case complexity
\[O(n^4(log n+ log \verb?||M||?)+x^3 log^2 \verb?||M||?)\], 
where $n$ is the dimension of the matrix
and \verb?||M||? is a bound on the entries in $M$, but with 
average expected complexity 
\[O(n^4+m^3(log n + log \verb?||M||?)^2)\],
assuming some plausible properties about the distribution of $M$.
We will also describe a practical version of the algorithm and include
timing data to compare this algorithm with existing ones. Our result
does not depend on ``fast'' integer or matrix techniques.

There are many problems with the simplification of elementary
functions, particularly over the complex plane. Systems tend to make
``howlers'' or not to simplify enough. In this paper we outline the
``unwinding number'' approach to such problems, and show how it can be
used to prevent errors and to systematise such simplification, even
though we have not yet reduced the simplification process to a
complete algorithm.  The unsolved problems are probably more amenable
to the techniques of artificial intelligence and theorem proving than
the original problem of complex-variable analysis.

A four-parameter fit is developed for the class of integrals known as
the exponential integral (real branch). Unlike other fits that are
piecewise in nature, the current fit to the exponential integral is
valid over the complete domain of the function (compact) and is
everywhere accurate to within $\pm 0.0052\%$ when evaluating the first
exponential integral, $E_1$. To achieve this result, a methodology
that makes use of analytically known limiting behaviors at either
extreme of the domain is employed. Because the fit accurately captures
limiting behaviors of the $E_1$ function, more accuracy is retained
when the fit is used as part of the scheme to evaluate higher-order
exponential integrals, $E_n$, as compared with the use of brute-force
fits to $E_1$, which fail to accurately model limiting
behaviors. Furthermore, because the fit is compact, no special
accommodations are required (as in the case of spliced piecewise fits)
to smooth the value, slope, and higher derivatives in the transition
region between two piecewise domains. The general methodology employed
to develop this fit is outlined, since it may be used for other
problems as well.

This is a writeup detailing the more accurate fits to $E_1(x)$,
relative to those presented in ARL-TR-1758.  My actual fits are to 
\[F1 =[x\ exp(x) E_1(x)]\] which spans a functional range from 0 to 1.  
The best accuracy I have been yet able to achieve, defined by limiting 
the value of \[[(F1)_{fit} - F1]/F1\] over the domain, is approximately 
3.1E-07 with a 12-parameter fit, which unfortunately isn't quite to 32-bit
floating-point accuracy.  Nonetheless, the fit is not a piecewise fit,
but rather a single continuous function over the domain of nonnegative x, 
which avoids some of the problems associated with piecewise domain splicing.

This thesis is concerned with calculating polynomial greatest common
divisors using straight line program representation.

In the Introduction chapter, we introduce the problem and describe
some of the traditional representations for polynomials, we then talk
about some of the general subjects central to the thesis, terminating
with a synopsis of the category theory which is central to the Axiom
computer algebra system used during this research.

The second chapter is devoted to describing category theory. We follow
with a chapter detailing the important sections of computer code
written in order to investigate the straight line program subject.
The following chapter on evalution strategies and algorithms which are
dependant on these follows, the major algorith which is dependant on
evaluation and which is central to our theis being that of equality
checking. This is indeed central to many mathematical problems.
Interpolation, that is the determination of coefficients of a
polynomial is the subject of the next chapter. This is very important
for many straight line program algorithms, as their non-canonical
structure implies that it is relatively difficult to determine
coefficients, these being the basic objects that many algorithms work
on. We talk about three separate interpolation techniques and compare
their advantages and disadvantages. The final two chapters describe
some of the results we have obtained from this research and finally
conclusions we have drawn as to the viability of the straight line
program approach and possible extensions.

Finally we terminate with a number of appendices discussing side
subjects encountered during the thesis.

It has an algorithm for correctly predetermining leading coefficients

In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum
processes.  In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these
diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and
topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a
``cobordism'': a manifold representing spacetime, going between two
manifolds representing space.  But this was just the beginning: simiar
diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent
proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise
of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became
clear that there is an extensive network of analogies between physics,
topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make
some of these analogies precise using the concept of ``closed
symmetric monodial category''. We assume no prior knowledge of
category theory, proof theory or computer science.

wrestling with technicalities. We illustrate this claim by considering
symbolic definite integration, and present a verifiable symbolic
definite integral table look up: a system which matches a query
comprising a definite integral with parameters and side conditions,
against an entry in a verifiable table and uses a call to a library of
lemmas about the reals in the theorem prover PVS to aid in the
transformation of the table entry into an answer. We present the full
model of such a system as well as a description of our prototype
implementation showing the efficacy of such a system: for example, the
prototype is able to obtain correct answers in cases where computer
algebra systems [CAS] do not. We extend upon Fateman's web-based table
by including parametric limits of integration and queries with side
conditions.

The use of computer algebra is usually considered beneficial for
mechanised reasoning in mathematical domains. We present a case study,
in the application domain of coding theory, that supports this claim:
the mechanised proofs depend on non-trivial algorithms from computer
algebra and increase the reasoning power of the theorem prover.

The unsoundness of computer algebra systems is a major problem in
interfacing them to theorem provers. Our approach to obtaining a sound
overall system is not blanket distrust but based on the distinction
between algorithms we call sound and {\sl ad hoc} respectively. This
distinction is blurred in most computer algebra systems. Our
experimental interface therefore uses a computer algebra library. It
is based on formal specifications for the algorithms, and links the
computer algebra library Sumit to the prover Isabelle.

We give details of the interface, the use of the computer algebra
system on the tactic-level of Isabelle and its integration into proof
procedures.

The FOC project aims at supporting, within a coherent software system,

theories, ending with certified implementations of algorithms. In this
paper, we explain our design requirements for the implementation,
using polynomials as a running example. Indeed, proving correctness of
implementations depends heavily on the way this design allows
mathematical properties to be truly handled at the programming level.

The FOC project, started at the fall of 1997, is aimed to build a
programming environment for the development of certified symbolic
computation. The working languages are Coq and Ocaml. In this paper,
we present first the motivations of the project. We then explain why

Functional programmers often reason about programs as if they were
written in a total language, expecting the results to carry over to
non-toal (partial) languages. We justify such reasoning.

Two languages are defined, one total and one partial, with identical
syntax. The semantics of the partial language includes partial and
infinite values, and all types are lifted, including the function
spaces. A partial equivalence relation (PER) is then defined, the
domain of which is the total subset of the partial language. For types
not containing function spaces the PER relates equal values, and
functions are related if they map related values to related values.

It is proved that if two closed terms have the same semantics in the
total language, then they have related semantics in the partial
language. It is also shown that the PER gives rise to a bicartesian
closed category which can be used to reason about values in the domain
of the relation.

In considering the reliability of numerical programs, it is normal to
``limit our study to the semantics dealing with numerical precision''.
On the other hand, there is a great deal of work on the reliability of
programs that essentially ignores the numerics. The thesis of this
paper is that there is a class of problems that fall between these
two, which could be described as ``does the low-level arithmeti
implement the high-level mathematics''. Many of these problems arise
because mathematics, particularly the mathematics of the complex
numbers, is more difficult than expected: for example the complex
function log is not continuous, writing down a program to compute an
inverse function is more complicated than just solving an equation,
and many algebraic simplification rules are not universally valid.

The good news is that these problems are {\sl theoretically} capable
of being solved, and are {\sl practically} close to being solved, but
not yet solved, in several real-world examples. However, there is
still a long way to go before implementations match the theoretical
possibilities.

Computer algebra systems typically drop some degenerate cases when

$x=0$. We claim that it is feasible in practice to compute also the
degenerate cases yielding {\sl guarded expressions}. We work over real
closed fields but our ideas about handling guarded expressions can be
easily transferred to other situations. Using formulas as guards
provides a powerful tool for heuristically reducing the combinatorial
explosion of cases: equivalent, redundant, tautological, and
contradictive cases can be detected by simplification and quantifier
elimination. Our approach allows to simplify the expressions on the
basis of simplification knowledge on the logical side. The method
described in this paper is implemented in the REDUCE package GUARDIAN,

In our current work a library of formally verified software components
is to be created, and assembled, using the Low-Level Virtual Machine
(LLVM) intermediate form, into subsystems whose top-level assurance
relies on the assurance of the individual components. We have thus
undertaken a project to build a translator from LLVM to the
applicative subset of Common Lisp accepted by the ACL2 theorem
prover. Our translator produces executable ACL2 formal models,
allowing us to both prove theorems about the translated models as well
as validate those models by testing.  The resulting models can be
translated and certified without user intervention, even for code with
loops, thanks to the use of the def::ung macro which allows us to
defer the question of termination. Initial measurements of concrete
execution for translated LLVM functions indicate that performance is
nearly 2.4 million LLVM instructions per second on a typical laptop
computer. In this paper we overview the translation process and
illustrate the translator's capabilities by way of a concrete example,
including both a functional correctness theorem as well as a
validation test for that example.

Our basic premise is that the ability to construct and modify programs
will not improve without a new and comprehensive look at the entire
programming process. Past theoretical research, say, in the logic of
programs, has tended to focus on methods for reasoning about
individual programs; little has been done, it seems to us, to develop
a sound understanding of the process of programming -- the process by
which programs evolve in concept and in practice. At present, we lack
the means to describe the techniques of program construction and
improvement in ways that properly link verification, documentation and
adaptability.

In order to find subtle bugs in a system design, it is necessary to
have a precise description of that design. There are at least two
major benefits to writing a precise design; the author is forced to
think more clearly, which helps eliminate ``plausible hand-waving'',
and tools can be applied to check for errors in the design, even while
it is being written. In contrast, conventional design documents
consist of prose, static diagrams, and perhaps pseudo-code in an ad
hoc untestable language. Such descriptions are far from precise; they
are often ambiguous, or omit critical aspects such as partial failure
or the granularity of concurrency (i.e. which constructs are assumed
to be atomic). At the other end of the spectrum, the final executable
code is unambiguous, but contains an overwhelming amount of detail. We
needed to be able to capture the essence of a design in a few hundred
lines of precise description. As our designs are unavoidably complex,
we need a highly-expressive language, far above the level of code, but
with precise semantics. That expressivity must cover real-world
concurrency and fault-tolerance. And, as we wish to build services
quickly, we wanted a language that is simple to learn and apply,
avoiding esoteric concepts. We also very much wanted an existing
ecosystem of tools.  We found what we were looking for in TLA+, a
formal specification language.

way as is done in theorem provers based on type theory such as Nuprl
or Coq.

The paper shows an interesting way to decorate Axiom with pre- and

Using a representation that reflects only the intrinsic information of
an object, and storing application-dependent information in so-called
{\sl application descriptions}, it is shown how the translation from
the internal to an external representation and {\sl vice versa} can be
achieved. Hereby a formalisation of the concept of {\sl context} is
introduced. The proposed scheme allows for a high degree of
application integration, e.g., parallel evaluation of subexpressions
(by different computer algebra systems), or a proof checker using a
computer algebra system to verify an equation involving a symbolic

equations having finite linear dimension. We then use those extensions

completed to solutions of the original system.

We propose a new algorithm, similar to Hermite's method for the
integration of rational functions, for the resolution of Risch
differential equations in closed form, or proving that they have no
resolution. By requiring more of the presentation of our differential
fields (in particular that the exponentials be weakly normalized), we
can avoid the introduction of arbitrary constants which have to be
solved for later.

We also define a class of fields known as exponentially reduced, and
show that solutions of Risch differential equations which arise from
integrating in these fields satisfy the ``natural'' degree constraints
in their main variables, and we conjecture (after Risch and Norman)
that this is true in all variables.

Computer algebra systems often have to deal with piecewise continuous
functions. These are, for example, the absolute value function,
signum, piecewise defined functions but also functions that are the
supremum or infimum of two functions. We present a new algebraic
approach to these types of problems. This paper presents a normal form
for a function ring containing piecewise polynomial functions of an
expression. The main result is that this normal form can be used to
decide extensional equality of two piecewise functions. Also we define
supremum and infimum for piecewise functions; in fact, we show that
the function ring forms a lattice. Additionally, a method to solve
equalities and inequalities in this function ring is
presented. Finally, we give a ``user interface'' to the algebraic
representation of the piecewise functions.

This paper surveys some recent applications of quantifier elimination
on real closed fields in the context of differential
equations. Although polynomial vector fields give rise to solutions
involving the exponential and other transcendental functions in
general, many questions can be settled within the real closed field
without referring to the real exponential field. The technique of
quantifier elimination on real closed fields is not only of
theoretical interest, but due to recent advances on the algorithmic
side including algorithms for the simplification of quantifier-free
formulae the method has gained practical applications, e.g. in the
context of computing threshold conditions in epidemic modeling.

The Kovacic algorithm and its improvements give explicit formulae for

equations. Algorithms for third order differential equations also
exist, but the tools they use are more sophisticated and the
computations more involved. In this paper we refine parts of the
algorithm to find Liouvillian solutions of third order equations. We
show that,except for four finite groups and a reduction to the second
order case, it is possible to give a formula in the imprimitve
case. We also give necessary conditions and several simplifications
for the computation of the minimal polynomial for the remaining finite
set of finite groups (or any known finite group) by extracting
ramification information from the character table. Several examples
have been constructed, illustrating the possibilities and limitations.

We extend a recent algorithm of Trager to a decision procedure for the
indefinite integration of elementary functions. We can express the
integral as an elementary function or prove that it is not
elementary. We show that if the problem of integration in finite terms
is solvable on a given elementary function field $k$, then it is
solvable in any algebraic extension of $k(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is
a logarithm or exponential of an element of $k$. Our proof considers
an element of such an extension field to be an algebraic function of
one variable over $k$.

In his algorithm for the integration of algebraic functions, Trager
describes a Hermite-type reduction to reduce the problem to an
integrand with only simple finite poles on the associated Riemann
surface. We generalize that technique to curves over liouvillian
ground fields, and use it to simplify our integrands.  Once the
multipe finite poles have been removed, we use the Puiseux expansions
of the integrand at infinity and a generalization of the residues to
compute the integral. We also generalize a result of Rothstein that
gives us a necessary condition for elementary integrability, and
provide examples of its use.

Parallel integration is an alternative method for symbolic
integration.  While also based on Liouville's theorem, it handles all
the generators of the differential field containing the integrand ``in
parallel'', i.e.  all at once rather than considering only the topmost
one in a recursive fasion. Although it still contains heuristic
aspects, its ease of implementation, speed, high rate of success, and
ability to integrate functions that cannot be handled by the Risch
algorithm make it an attractive alternative.

appear in the integral of a finite number.  This reduces the problem

incomplete $\Gamma$ functions. This class of special functions
includes the exponential integral, the error functions, the sine and

here is an improvement over those published previously for integrating
with special functions in the following ways: (i) This algorithm
combines all the above special functions into one algorithm, whereas
previously they were treated separately, (ii) Previous algorithms
require that the underlying field of constants be algebraically
closed. This algorithm, however, works over any field of
characteristic zero in which the basic field operations can be carried
out. (iii) This algorithm does not rely on Risch's solution of the
differential equation $y^\prime + fy = g$. Instead, a more direct

elementary integrals, and we can use the language of algebraic
geometry and the techniques of Davenport to yield an algorithm that will
always produce the integral if it exists. We explain the difficulty in
the way of extending this algorithm, and outline some ways of solving

A new integration system, employing both algorithmic and pattern match
integration schemes is presented. The organization of the system
differs from that of earlier programs in its emphasis on the
algorithmic approach to integration, its modularity and its ease of
revision. The new Norman-Rish algorithm and its implementation at the
University of Cambridge are employed, supplemented by a powerful
collection of simplification and transformation rules. The facility
for user defined integrals and functions is also included. The program
is both fast and powerful, and can be easily modified to incorporate
anticipated developments in symbolic integration.

Algorithms for symbolic partial fraction decomposition and indefinite
integration of rational functions are described. Two types of
partial fraction decomposition are investigated, square-free and
complete square-free. A method is derived, based on the solution of
a linear system, which produces the square-free decomposition of any
rational function, say A/B. The computing time is show to be 
$O(n^4(ln nf)^2)$ where ${\rm deg}(A) < {\rm\ deg}(B) = n$ and $f$
is a number which is closely related to the size of the coefficients
which occur in A and B. The complete square-free partical fraction
decomposition can then be directly obtained and it is shown that the
computing time for this process is also bounded by $O(n^4(ln nf)^2)$.

An algorithm is given for the integration of a class of

real variable, because the functions considered do not in general
allow integration in the complex plane to be defined. The class of
integrands includes commonly occurring waveforms, such as square
waves, triangular waves, and the floor function; it also includes the
signum function.  The algorithm can be implemented recursively, and it
has the property of ensuring that integrals are continuous on domains
of maximum extent.

integration, when to issue conditional results, how to assess
(possibly conditional) convergence, and more. These various

By the end of the 1960s it had been shown that a computer could find
indefinite integrals with a competence exceeding that of typical
undergraduates. This practical advance was backed up by algorithmic
interpretations of a number of clasical results on integration, and by
some significant mathematical extensions to these same results. At
that time it would have been possible to claim that all the major
barriers in the way of a complete system for automated analysis had
been breached. In this paper we survey the work that has grown out of
the above-mentioned early results, showing where the development has
been smooth and where it has spurred work in seemingly unrelated fields.

The general goal of this thesis is to investigate and develop computer
algebra tools for the simplification resp. evaluation of definite
integrals. One way of finding the value of a def- inite integral is
via the evaluation of an antiderivative of the integrand. In the
nineteenth century Joseph Liouville was among the first who analyzed
the structure of elementary antiderivatives of elementary functions
systematically. In the early twentieth century the algebraic structure
of differential fields was introduced for modeling the differential
properties of functions. Using this framework Robert H. Risch
published a complete algorithm for transcendental elementary
integrands in 1969. Since then this result has been extended to
certain other classes of integrands as well by Michael F. Singer,
Manuel Bronstein, and several others. On the other hand, if no
antiderivative of suitable form is available, then linear relations
that are satisfied by the parameter integral of interest may be found
based on the principle of parametric integration (often called
differentiating under the integral sign or creative telescoping).

The main result of this thesis extends the results mentioned above to
a complete algo- rithm for parametric elementary integration for a
certain class of integrands covering a majority of the special
functions appearing in practice such as orthogonal polynomials,
polylogarithms, Bessel functions, etc. A general framework is provided
to model those functions in terms of suitable differential fields. If
the integrand is Liouvillian, then the present algorithm considerably
improves the efficiency of the corresponding algorithm given by Singer
et al. in 1985. Additionally, a generalization of Czichowski’s
algorithm for computing the logarithmic part of the integral is
presented. Moreover, also partial generalizations to include other
types of integrands are treated.

As subproblems of the integration algorithm one also has to find
solutions of linear or- dinary differential equations of a certain
type. Some contributions are also made to solve those problems in our
setting, where the results directly dealing with systems of
differential equations have been joint work with Moulay A. Barkatou.

For the case of Liouvillian integrands we implemented the algorithm in
form of our Mathematica package Integrator. Parts of the
implementation also deal with more general functions. Our procedures
can be applied to a significant amount of the entries in integral
tables, both indefinite and definite integrals. In addition, our
procedures have been successfully applied to interesting examples of
integrals that do not appear in these tables or for which current
standard computer algebra systems like Mathematica or Maple do not
succeed. We also give examples of how parameter integrals coming from
the work of other researchers can be solved with the software, e.g.,
an integral arising in analyzing the entropy of certain processes.

Symbolic integration deals with the evaluation of integrals in closed

developments. The algorithms discussed are suited for both indefinite
and definite integration. They can also be used to compute linear
relations among integrals and to find identities for special functions
given by parameter integrals. The aim of this presentation is twofold:
to introduce the reader to some basic idea of differential algebra in
the context of integration and to raise awareness in the physics

Computing integrals is a common task in many areas of science,
antiderivatives are one way to accomplish this.  The problem of
integration in finite terms can be states as follows. Given a
differential field $(F,D)$ and $f \in F$, compute $g$ in some
elementary extension of $(F,D)$ such that $Dg = f$ if such a $g$
exists.

This problem has been solved for various classes of fields $F$.  For
rational functions $(C(x), \frac{d}{dx})$ such a $g$ always exists and
algorithms to compute it are known already for a long time. In 1969
Risch published an algorithm that solves this problem when $(F,D)$ is
a transcendental elementary extension of $(C(x),\frac{d}{dx})$. Later
this has been extended towards integrands being Liouvillian functions
by Singer et. al. via the use of regular log-explicit extensions of
$(C(x),\frac{d}{dx})$. Our algorithm extends this to handling
transcendental Liouvillian extensions $(F,D)$ of $(C,0)$ directly
without the need to embed them into log-explicit extensions. For
example, this means that
\[\int{(z-x)x^{z-1}e^{-x}dx} = x^ze^{-x}\]
can be computed without including log(x) in the differential field.

Defining a function with one variable to be elemetary if it has an
explicit representation in terms of a finite number of algebraic
operations, logarithms, and exponentials. Liouville's theorem in its
simplest case says that if an algebraic function has an elementary
integral then the latter is itself an algebraic function plus a sum of
constant multiples of logarithms of algebraic functions. Ostrowski has
generalized Liouville's results to wider classes of meromorphic
functions on regions of the complex plane and J.F. Ritt has given the
classical account of the entire subject in his Integraion in Finite
Terms, Columbia University Press, 1948. In spite of the essentially
algebraic nature of the problem, all proofs so far have been analytic.
This paper gives a self contained purely algebraic exposition of the
probelm, making a few new points in addition to the resulting

In this thesis we cover some aspects of the theory necessary to obtain
a canonical form for functions obtained by integration and
exponentiation from the set of rational functions.

These aspects include a new algorithm for symbolic integration of
functions involving logarithms and exponentials which avoids
factorization of polynomials in those cases where algebraic extension
of the constant field is not required, avoids partial fraction
decompositions, and only solves linear systems with a small number of
unknowns.

We have also found a theorem which states, roughly speaking, that if
integrals which can be represented as logarithms are represented as
such, the only algebraic dependence that a new exponential or
logarithm can satify is given by the law of exponents or the law of
logarithms.

Risch.  The new theorem gives all the possible algebraic relationships
among functions that can be built up from the rational functions by
algebraic operations, by taking exponentials, and by integration. The
functions so generated are called exponential and primitive functions.
From the theorem an algorithm for determining algebraic dependence
among a given set of exponential and primitive functions is derived.
The algorithm is then applied to a problem in computer algebra.

In Part 1 of this paper, we give an extension of Liouville's Theorem
and give a number of examples which show that integration with special
functions involves some phenomena that do not occur in integration
with the elementary functions alone. Our main result generalizes
Liouville's Theorem by allowing, in addition to the elementary
functions, special functions such as the error function, Fresnel
integrals and the logarithmic integral (but not the dilogarithm or
exponential integral) to appear in the integral of an elementary
function. The basic conclusion is that these functions, if they
appear, appear linearly. We give an algorithm which decides if an
elementary function, built up using only exponential functions and
rational operations has an integral which can be expressed in terms of
elementary functions and error functions.

\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
Symbolic integration is the problem of expressing an indefinite integral
$\int{f}$ of a given function $f$ as a finite combination $g$ of elementary
functions, or more generally, to determine whether a certain class of
functions contains an element $g$ such that $g^\prime = f$.

In the first part of this thesis, we compare different algorithms for
symbolic integration. Specifically, we review the integration rules
taught in calculus courses and how they can be used systematically to
create a reasonable, but somewhat limited, integration method. Then we
present the differential algebra required to prove the transcendental
cases of Risch's algorithm. Risch's algorithm decides if the integral
of an elementary function is elementary and if so computes it. The
presentation is mostly self-contained and, we hope, simpler than
previous descriptions of the algorithm. Finally, we describe
Risch-Norman's algorithm which, although it is not a decision
procedure, works well in practice and is considerably simpler than the
full Risch algorithm.

In the second part of this thesis, we briefly discuss an
implementation of a computer algebra system and some of the
experiences it has given us.  We also demonstrate an implementation of
the rule-based approach and how it can be used, not only to compute
integrals, but also to generate readable derivations of the results.

Given a base field $k$, of characteristic zero, with effective
procedures for performing arithmetic and factoring polynomials, this
thesis presents algorithms for extending those capabilities to
elements of a finite algebraic symbolic manipulation system. An
algebraic factorization algorithm along with a constructive version of
the primitive element theorem is used to construct splitting fields of
polynomials. These fields provide a context in which we can operate
symbolically with all the roots of a set of polynomials. One
application for this capability is rational function integrations. 
Previously presented symbolic algorithms concentrated on finding the 
rational part and were only able to compute the complete
integral in special cases. This thesis presents an algorithm for
finding an algebraic extension field of least degreee in which the
integral can be expressed, and then constructs the integral in that
field.  The problem of algebraic function integration is also
examined, and a highly efficient procedure is presented for generating
the algebraic part of integrals whose function fields are defined by a
single radical extension of the rational functions.

Modern computer algebra systems symbolically integrate a vast variety

of rational functions as well as the Rothstein/Trager method for
rational and for elementary functions. Further applications of the

In [5], we introduced an algorithm for deciding whether a proposed
simplification of elementary functions was correct in the presence of
branch cuts. This algorithm used multivalued function simplification
followed by verification that the branches were consistent.

In [14] an algorithm was presented for zero-testing functions defined
by ordinary differential equations, in terms of their power series.

The purpose of the current paper is to investigate merging the two
techniques. In particular, we will show an explicit reduction to the
constant problem [16].

One of the problems with manipulating function identities in computer
algebra systems is that they often involve functions which are
multivalued, whilst most users tend to work with single-valued
functions.  The problem is that many well-known identities may no
longer be true everywhere in the complex plane when working with their
single-valued counterparts. Conversely, we cannot ignore them, since
in particular contexts they may be valid. We investigate the
practicality of a method to verify such identities by means of an
experiment; this is based on a set of test examples which one might
realistically meet in practice.  Essentially, the method works as
follows. We decompose the complex plane via means of cylindrical
algebraic decomposition into regions with respect to the branch cuts
of the functions. We then test the identity numerically at a sample
point in the region. The latter step is facilitated by the notion of
the {\sl adherence} of a branch cut, which was previously introduced
by the authors. In addition to presenting the results of the
experiment, we explain how adherence relates to the proposal of 
{\sl signed zeros} by W. Kahan, and develop this idea further in order to
allow us to cover previously untreatable cases. Finally, we discuss
other ways to improve upon our general methodology as well as topics
for future research.

There are many problems with the simplification of elementary
functions, particularly over the complex plane, though not
exclusively. Systems tend to make ``howlers'' or not to simplify
enough. In this paper we outline the ``unwinding number'' approach to
such problems, and show how it can be used to prevent errors and to
systematise such simplification, even though we have not yet reduced
the simplification process to a complete algorithm. The unsolved
problems are probably more amenable to the techniques of artificial
intelligence and theorem proving than the original problem of complex
variable analysis.

Although, formally, mathematics is clear that a function is a
single-valued object, mathematical practice is looser, particularly
with n-th roots and various inverse functions. In this paper, we point
out some of the looseness, and ask what the implications are, both for
Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation, of these practices.
In doing so, we look at the steps necessary to convert existing tests
into
\begin{itemize}
\item (a) rigorous statements
\item (b) rigorously proved statements
\end{itemize}
In particular we ask whether there might be a constant ``de Bruij factor''
[18] as we make these texts more formal, and conclude that the answer
depends greatly on the interpretation being placed on the symbols.

In considering the reliability of numerical programs, it is normal to
``limit our study to the semantics dealing with numerical precision''.
On the other hand, there is a great deal of work on the reliability of
programs that essentially ignores the numerics. The thesis of this
paper is that there is a class of problems that fall between the two,
which could be described as ``does the low-level arithmetic implement
the high-level mathematics''. Many of these problems arise because
mathematics, particularly the mathematics of the complex numbers, is
more difficult than expected; for example the complex function log is
not continuous, writing down a program to compute an inverse function
is more complicated than just solving an equation, and many algebraic
simplification rules are not universally valid.

The good news is that these problems are theoretically capable of
being solved, and are practically close to being solved, but not yet
solved, in several real-world examples. However, there is still a long
way to go before implementations match the theoretical possibilities.

calculating the roots of a cubic polynomial from the Cardano formulae,
which contains fractional powers. We show that some definitions of
these functions result in formulae that are correct only in the sense
that they give candidates for solutions; these candidates must then be
tested. Formulae that are based on single-valued functions, in

Once it is decided that a CAS will evaluate multivalued functions on
their principal branches, questions arise concerning the branch
definitions. The first questions concern the standardization of the
positions of the branch cuts. These questions have largely been
resolved between the various algebra systems and the numerical
libraries, although not completely. In contrast to the computer
systems, many mathematical textbooks are much further behind: for
example, many popular textbooks still specify that the argument of a
complex number lies between 0 and $2\pi$. We do not intend to discuss
these first questions here, however. Once the positions of the branch
cuts have been fixed, a second set of questions arises concerning the

In this paper we present a new deterministic algorithm for computing
the square-free decomposition of multivariate polynomials with
coefficients from a finite field.

Our algorithm is based on Yun's square-free factorization algorithm
for characteristic 0. The new algorithm is more efficient than
existing, deterministic algorithms based on Musser's squarefree
algorithm

We will show that the modular approach presented by Yun has no
significant performance advantage over our algorithm. The new
algorithm is also simpler to implement and it can rely on any existing
GCD algorithm without having to worry about choosing "good" evaluation

To demonstrate this, we present some timings using implementations in
Maple (Char et al. 1991), where the new algorithm is used for Release
4 onwards, and Axiom (Jenks and Sutor, 1992) which is the only system
known to the author to use and implementation of Yun's modular
algorithm mentioned above.

In the vein of recent algorithmic advances in polynomial factorization
based on lifting and recombination techniques, we present new faster
algorithms for computing the absolute factorization of a bivariate
polynomial. The running time of our probabilistic algorithm is less
than quadratic in the dense size of the polynomial to be factored.

We present new deterministic and probabilistic algorithms that reduce
the factorization of dense polynomials from several variables to one
variable.  The deterministic algorithm runs in sub-quadratic time in
the dense size of the input polynomial, and the probabilistic
algorithm is softly optimal when the number of variables is at least
three. We also investigate the reduction from several to two variables
and improve the quantitative versions of Bertini's irreducibility theorem.

The concept of polynomial squarefree decomposition is an important one
in algebraic computation. The squarefree decomposition process has
many uses in computer symbolic computation. A recent survey by D. Yun
[3] describes many useful algorithms for this purpose. All of these
methods depend on computing the greated common divisor (gcd) of the
polynomial to be decomposed and its first derivative (with repect to
some variable). In the multivariate case, this gcd computation is
non-trivial and dominates the cost for the squarefree decompostion.

\end{chunk}

\begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
Previously known algorithms for polynomial square-free decomposition
rely on greatest common divisor (gcd) computations over the same
coefficient domain where the decomposition is to be performed. In
particular, gcd of the given polynomial and its first derivative (with
respect to some variable) is obtained to begin with. Application of
modular homomorphism and $p$-adic construction (multivariate case) or
the Chinese remainder algorithm (univariate case) results in new
square-free decomposition algorithms which, generally speaking, take
less time than a single gcd between the given polynomial and its first
derivative. The key idea is to obtain one or several ``correct''
homomorphic images of the desired square-free decomposition
first. This provides information as to how many different square-free
factors there are, their multiplicities and their homomorphic
images. Since the multiplicities are known, only the square-free
factors need to be constructed. Thus, these new algorithms are
relatively insensitive to the multiplicities of the square-free factors.
