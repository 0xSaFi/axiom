\chapter{The Axiom Bibliography}
This bibliography covers areas of computational mathematics.
Papers which mention Axiom have a ``keyword='' entry of ``axiomref''.
Papers we have on site have a ``paper='' entry.

The authors are listed in the index. The topic keywords are listed in the
index. Algorithms are mentioned in the index. 

The {\bf TO} index entry tries to say that the first
named algorithm or author has been updated or improved by the second
named algorithm or author.

Introduction of special terms (e.g. Toeplitz matrix) may include a
paragraph for those unfamiliar with the terms.

   "In this paper we will explore the nonassociative algebraic structure

    the generations. While modern understanding of genetic inheritance
    initiated with the theories of Charles Darwin, it was the Augustinian
    monk Gregor Mendel who began to uncover the mathematical nature of the
    subject. In fact, the symbolism Mendel used to describe his first
    results (e.g. see his 1866 paper {\sl Experiments in
    Plant-Hybridization} is quite algebraically suggestive. Seventy four
    years later, I.M.H. Etherington introduced the formal language of
    abstract algebra to the study of genetics in his series of seminal
    papers. In this paper we will discuss the concepts of genetics that
    suggest the underlying algebraic structure of inheritance, and we will
    give a brief overview of the algebras which arise in genetics and some
    of their basi properties and relationships. With the popularity of
    biologically motivated mathematics continuing to rise, we offer this
    survey article as another example of the breadth of mathematics that
    has biological significance. The most comprehensive reference for the

    Sparse and structured matrices over finite fields occur in many
    settings.  Sparse linear systems arise in sieve-based integer factoring
    and discrete logarithm algorithms. Structured matrices arise in
    polynomial factoring algorithms; one example is the famous Q-matrix
    from Berlekamp's method.  Sparse diophantine linear problems, like
    computing the Smith canonical form of an integer matrix or computing
    an integer solution to a sparse linear system, are reduced via p-adic
    lifting to sparse matrix analysis over a finite field.

    In the past 10 years there has been substantial activity on the
    improvement of a solution proposed by Wiedemann in 1986. The main new
    ingredients are faster pre-conditioners, projections by an entire
    block of random vectors, Lanczos recurrences, and a connection to
    Kalman realizations of control theory. My talk surveys these
    developments and describe some major unresolved problems."

    The main idea of the ``black box'' approach in exact linear algebra is
    to reduce matrix problems to the computation of minimum polynomials.
    In most cases preconditioning is necessary to obtain the desired
    result.  Here good preconditioners will be used to ensure geometrical
    / algebraic properties on matrices, rather than numerical ones, so we
    do not address a condition number. We offer a review of problems for
    which (algebraic) preconditioning is used, provide a bestiary of
    preconditioning problems, and discuss several preconditioner types to
    solve these problems.  We present new conditioners, including
    conditioners to preserve low displacement rank for Toeplitz-like
    matrices. We also provide new analyses of preconditioner performance
    and results on the relations among preconditioning problems and with
    linear algebra problems.  Thus, improvements are offered for the
    efficiency and applicability of preconditioners. The focus is on
    linear algebra problems over finite fields, but most results are valid

    The computation of the determinant of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ of
    numbers or polynomials is a challenge for both numerical and symbolic
    methods. Numerical methods, such as Clarkson's algorithm [10,7] for
    the sign of the determinant must deal with conditionedness that
    determines the number of mantissa bits necessary for obtaining a
    correct sign. Symbolic algorithms that are based on Chinese
    remaindering [6,17,Chapter 5.5] must deal with the fact that the
    length of the determinant in the worse case grows linearly in the
    dimension of the matrix. Hence the number of modular operations is $n$
    times the number of arithmetic operations in a given algorithm.
    Hensel lifting combined with rational number recovery [14,1] has cubic
    bit complexity in $n$, but the algorithm can only determine a factor
    of the determinant, namely the largest invariant factor. If the matrix
    is similar to a multiple of the identity matrix, the running time is
    again that of Chinese remaindering."

\index{explain!Sylvester matrix}
The Sylvester matrix is used to compute the {\bf resultant} of two
polynomials. The Sylvester matrix is formed from the coefficients of
the two polynomials. Given a polynomial with degree $m$ and another of
degree $n$ form an $(m+n)\times(m+n)$ matrix by filling the matrix
from the upper left corner with the coefficients of the first
polynomial then shifting down one row and one column to the right and
filling in the coefficients starting there until they hit the right
column.  Starting at the next row, do the same process for the second
polynomial.  The determinant of this matrix is the {\bf resultant} of
the two polynomials.

For example, given $a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$ and $b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0$
the Sylvester matrix is a $(3+2)\times(3+2)$ matrix:
\[\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0 & 0\\
0 & a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0\\
b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0
\end{array}\right]\]

\index{explain!resultant}
The resultant of these two polynomials (assuming a leading coefficient
of 1), is the product of the differences $p_i-q_i$ between the roots
of the polynomials. If there are roots in common then the product
will contain a 0 and the whole equation reduces to 0. This can be
used to determine if two polynomials have common roots.

For example, given a polynomial in $x$ with distinct roots $a_1$ 
and $a_2$ it can be factored as $t1:=(x-a_1)(x-a_2)$. 

Given a second polynomial in $x$ with distinct roots $b_1$, $b_2$, 
and $b_3$ it can be factored as $t2:=(x-b_1)(x-b_2)(x-b_3)$.

The Axiom call of $resultant(t1,t2,x)$ is
\[ (b_1-a_2)(b_1-a_1)(b_2-a_2)(b_2-a_1)(b_3-a_2)(b_3-a_1) \]

In symbolic form the resultant can show the multiplicity of roots
when shown in factored form.

    The Toeplitz-likeness of a matrix (Kailath et al. 1979) is the
    generalization of the notion that a matrix is Toeplitz. Block matrices
    with Toeplitz blocks, such as the Sylvester matrix corresponding to
    the resultant of two univariate polynomials, are Toeplitz-like, as are
    products and inverses of Toeplitz-like matrices. The displacement rank
    of a matrix is a measure for the degree of being Toeplitz-like. For
    example, an $r\times s$ block matrix with Toeplitz blocks has
    displacement rank $r+s$ whereas a generic $N\ximtes N$ matrix has
    displacement rank $N$.  A matrix of displacement rank $\alpha$ can be
    implicitly represented by a sum of $\alpha$ matrices, each of which is
    the product of a lower trainagular and an upper triangular Toeplitz
    matrices. Such a $\sigmaLU$ representation can usually be obtained

    Douglas Wiedemann's (1986) landmark approach to solving sparse linear
    systems over finite fields provides the symbolic counterpart to
    non-combinatorial numerical methods for solving sparse linear systems,
    such as the Lanczos or conjugate gradient method (see Golub and van
    Loan (1983)). The problem is to solve a sparse linear system, when the
    individual entries lie in a generic field, and the only operations
    possible are field arithmethic; the solution is to be exact. Such is
    the situation, for instance, if one works in a finite field. Wiedemann
    bases his approach on Krylov subspaces, but projects further to a
    sequence of individual field elements. By making a link to the
    Berlekamp / Massey problem from coding theory -- the coordinate
    recurrences -- and by using randomization an algorithm is obtained
    with the following property. On input of an $n\times n$ coefficient
    matrix $A$ given by a so-called black box, which is a program that can
    multiply the matrix by a vector (see Figure 1), and of a vector $b$,
    the algorithm finds, with high probability in case the system is
    solvable, a random solution vector $x$ with $Ax=b$. It is assumed that
    the field has sufficiently many elements, say no less than $50n^2
    log(x)$, otherwise one goes to a finite algebraic extension. The
    complexity of the method is in the general singular case $O(n log
    (n))$ calls to the black box for $A$ and an additional $O(n^2
    log(n)^2)$ field arithmetic operations."

    The problem of solving a large sparse or structured system of linear
    equations in the symbolic context, for instance when the coefficients
    lie in a finite field, has arisen in several applications. A famous
    example are the linear systems of ${\bf F}_2$, the field with 2
    elements, that arise in sieve based integer factoring algorithms. For
    example, for the factorization of the RSA-130 challenge number several
    column dependencies of a $3504823\times 3516502$ matrix with an
    average of $39.4.$ non-zero entries per column needed to be computed
    [10]. A second example is the Berlekamp polynomial factorization
    algorithm [6]. In that example, the matrix is not explicitly
    constructed, but instead a fast algorithm for performing the matrix
    times vector product is used. Further examples for such ``black box
    matrices'' arise in the power series solutoin of algebraic or
    differential equations by undetermined coefficients. The arising
    linear systems for the coefficients usually have a distinct structure

    The success of the symbolic mathematical computation discipline is 
    striking. The theoretical advances have been continuous and significant:
    Gr{\"o}bner bases, the Risch integration algorithm, integer lattice 
    basis reduction, hypergeometric summation algorithms, etc. From the
    beginning in the early 60s, it has been the tradition of our discipline
    to create software that makes our ideas readily available to a 
    scientists, engineers, and education: {SAC-1}, {Reduce}, {Macsyma}, etc.
    The commercial viability of our system products is proven by Maple and
    Mathematica.

    Today's user communities of symbolic computation systems are diverse:
    educators, engineers, stock market anaysts, etc. The mathematics and
    computer science in the design and implementation of our algorithms are
    sophisticated. The research challenges in symbolic computation at the 
    close of the 20th century are formidable.

    I state my favorite eight open problems in symbolic computations. They
    range from problems in symbolic /numeric computing, symbolic algorithm
    synthesis, to system component construction. I have worked on seven of
    my problems and borrowed one from George Collins. I present background

    algebraic computation. The formula model essentially restricts the use
    of an intermediate result to a single place, because the parse tree
    nodes have fan-out one. If an intermediate result participates in the
    computations of several further nodes, in the tree model it must be
    recomputed anew for each of these nodes. It is a small formal change
    to allow node values to propagate to more than one node deeper level
    of the computation. Thus we obtain the {\sl algebraic circuit model},
    which is equivalent to the {\sl straight-line program model}."

    We give a stability criterion for real polynomial inequalities with
    floating point or inexact scalars by estimating from below or
    computing the radius of semdefiniteness. That radious is the maximum
    deformation of the polynomial coefficent vector measured in a weighted
    Euclidean vector norm within which the inequality remains true. A
    large radius means that the inequalities may be considered numerically
    valid.

    The radius of positive (or negative) semidefiniteness is the distance
    to the nearest polynomial with a real root, which has been thoroughly
    studied before. We solve this problem by parameterized Lagrangian
    multipliers and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Our algorithms can
    compute the radius for several simultaneous inequalities including
    possibly additional linear coefficient constraints. Our distance
    measure is the weighted Euclidena coefficient norm, but we also
    discuss several formulas for the weighted infinity and 1-norms.

    The computation of the nearest polynomial with a real root can be
    interpreted as a dual of Seidenberg's method that decides if a real
    hypersurface contains a real point. Sums-of-squares rational lower
    bound certificates for the radius of semidefinitesness provide a new
    approach to solving Seidenberg's problem, especially when the
    coeffcients are numeric. They also offer a surprising alternative
    sum-of-squares proof for those polynomials that themselves cannot be
    represented by a polynomial sum-of-squares but that have a positive
    distance to the nearest indefinte polynomial."

    Several standard problems in symbolic computation, such as greatest
    common divisors and factorization of polynomials, sparse
    interpolation, or computing solutions to overdetermined systems of
    polynomial equations have non-trivial solutions only if the input
    coefficients satisfy certain algebraic constraints. Errors in the
    coefficients due to floating point round-off or through physical
    measurement thus render the exact symbolic algorithms unusable. By
    symbolic-numeric methods one computes minimal deformations of the
    coefficients that yield non-trivial results. We will present hybrid
    algorithms and benchmark computations based on Gauss-Newton
    optimazation, singular value decomposition (SVD) and
    structure-preserving total least squares (STLS) fitting for several of
    the above problems.

    A significant body of results to solve those ``approximate computer
    algebra'' problems has been discovered in the past 10 years. In the
    Computer Algebra Handbook the section on ``Hybrid Methods'' concludes
    as follows [2]: ``The challenge of hybrid symbolic-numeric algorithms
    is to explore the effects of imprecision, discontinuity, and
    algorithmic complexity by applying mathematical optimization,
    perturbation theory, and inexact arithmetic and other tools in order
    to solve mathematical problems that today are not solvable by
    numeriiical or symbolic methods alone.'' The focus of our tutorial is
    on how to formulate several approximate symbolic computation problems
    as numerical problems in linear algebra and optimization and on
    software that realizes their solutions."

    We generalize the technique by Peyrl and Parillo [Proc. SNC 2007] to
    computing lower bound certificates for several well-known

    idea is to transform a numerical sum-of-squares (SOS) representation

    the irrational global optima for benchmark approximate polynomial
    greatest common divisors and multivariate polynomial irreducibility
    radii from the literature, and factor coefficient bounds in the
    setting of a model problem by Rump (up to $n=14$, factor degree $=13$).

    The numeric SOSes produced by the current fixed precision
    semi-definite programming (SDP) packages (SeDuMi, SOSTOOLS, YALMIP)
    are usually too coarse to allow successful projection to exact SOSes
    via Maple 11's exact linear algebra. Therefore, before projection we
    refine the SOSes by rank-preserving Newton iteration. For smaller
    problems the starting SOSes for Newton can be guessed without SDP
    (``SDP-free SOS''), but for larger inputs we additionally appeal to
    sparsity techniques in our SDP formulation."

    "We define reproducibility to mean getting bitwise identical results
    from multiple runs of the same program, perhaps with different
    hardware resources or other changes that should ideally not change the
    answer. Many users depend on reproducibility for debugging or
    correctness. However, dynamic scheduling of parallel computing
    resources, combined with nonassociativity of floating point addition,
    makes attaining reproducibility a challenge even for simple operations
    like summing a vector of numbers, or more complicated operations like
    Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). We describe an algorithm that
    computes a reproducible sum of floating point numbers independent of
    the order of summation. The algorithm depends only on a subset of the
    IEEE Floating Point Standard 754-2008. It is communication-optimal, in
    the sense that it does just one pass over the data in the sequential
    case, or one reduction operation in the parallel case, requiring an
    ``accumulator'' represented by just 6 floating point words (more can
    be used if higher precision is desired). Th arithmetic code with a
    6-word accumulator is $7n$ floating point additions to sum $n$ words,
    and (in IEEEE double precision) the final error bound can be up to
    $10^8$ times smaller than the error bound for conventional
    summation. We describe the basic summation algorithm, the software
    infrastructure used to build reproducible BLAS (ReproBLAS), and
    performance results. For example, when computing the dot product of
    4096 double precision floating point numbers, we get a $4x$ slowdown
    compared to Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) running on an Intel Core
    i7-2600 CPU operating at 3.4 GHz and 256 KB L2 Cache."

    "A suite of {\sl self-scaling} fast circular plane rotation algorithms
    is developed which obviates the monitoring and periodic rescaling
    necessitated by the standard set of fast plane rotation
    algorithms. Self-Scaling fast rotations dynamically preserve the
    normed scaling of the diagonal factor matrix whereas standard fast
    rotations exhibit divergent scaling. Variations on standard fast
    rotation matrices are developed and algorithms which implement them
    are offered. Self-Scaling fast rotations are shown to be essentially
    as accurate as slow rotations and at least as efficient as standard
    fast rotations. Computational experimental results utilizing the
    Cray-2 illustrate the effectively stable scaling exhibited by
    self-scaling fast rotations. Jacobi-class algorithms with one-sided
    alterations are developed for the algebraic eigenvalue decomposition
    using self-scaling fast plane rotations and one-sided
    modifications. The new algorithms are shown to be both accurate and
    efficient on both vector and parallel architectures. The utility is
    described of applying fast plane rotations towards the rank-one update
    and downdate of least squares factorizations. The equivalence is
    illuminated of LINPACK, hyperbolic rotation, and fast negatively
    weighted plane rotation downdating. Algorithms are presented which
    apply self-scaling fast plane rotations to the QR factorization for
    stiff least squares problems. Both fast and standard Givens
    rotation-based algorithms are shown to produce accurate results
    regardless of row sorting even with extremely heavily row weighted
    matrices. Such matrices emanate, e.g. from equality constrainted least
    squares problems solved via the weighting method. The necessity of
    column sorting is emphasized. Numerical tests expose the Householder
    QR factorization algorithm to be sensitive to row sorting and it
    yields less accurate results for greater weights. Additionally, the
    modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm is shown to be sensitive to row
    sorting to a notably significant but lesser degree. Self-Scaling fast
    plane rotation algorithms, having competitive computational
    complexities, must therefore be the method of choice for the QR
    factorization of stiff matrices. Timing reults on the Cray 2 [XY]M/P,
    and C90, of rotations both in and out of a matrix factorization
    context are presented. Architectural features that can best exploit
    the advantagous features of the new fast rotations are subsequently

    in the 1960s as a means to compute very accurate solutions to all but
    the most ill-conditioned linear systems of equations. However two
    obstacles hae until now prevented its adoption in standard subroutine
    libraries like LAPACK: (1) There was no standard way to access the
    higher precision arithmetic needed to compute residuals, and (2) it
    was unclear how to compute a reliable error bound for the computed
    solution. The completion of the new BLAS Technical Forum Standard has
    recently removed the first obstacle. To overcome the second obstacle,
    we show how a single application of iterative refindment can be used
    to copute an error bound in any norm at small cost, and use this to
    compute both an error bound in the usual infinity norm, and a
    componentwise relative error bound.

    We report extensive test results on over 6.2 million matrices of
    dimension 5, 10, 100, and 1000. As long as a normwise
    (resp. componentwise) condition number computed by the algorithm is
    less than $1/max(10,\sqrt{n})\epsilon_w$, the computed normwise
    (resp. componentwise) error bound is at most
    $2max(10,\sqrt{n})\epsilon_w$, and indeed bounds the true error. Here,
    $n$ is the matrix dimension and $\epsilon_w$ is a single precision
    roundoff error. For worse conditioned problems, we get similarly small
    correct error bounds in over 89.4\% of cases."

    "Computing the eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors of an $n\times n$
    symmetric tridiagonal matrix is an important task that arises while
    solving any symmetric eigenproblem. All practical software requires
    $O(n^3)$ time to compute all the eigenvectors and ensure their
    orthogonality when eigenvalues are close. In the first part of this
    thesis we review earlier work and show how some existing
    implementations of inverse iteration can fail in surprising ways.
    
    The main contribution of this thesis is a new $O(n^2)$, easily
    parallelizable algorithm for solving the tridiagonal
    eigenproblem. Three main advances lead to our new algorithm. A
    tridiagonal matrix is traditionally represented by its diagonal and
    off-diagonal elements. Our most important advance is in recognizing
    that its bidiagonal factors are ``better'' for computational
    purposes. The use of bidiagonals enables us to invoke a relative
    criterion to judge when eigenvalues are ``close''. The second advance
    comes with using multiple bidiagonal factorizations in order to
    compute different eigenvectors independently of each other. Thirdly,
    we use carefully chosen dqds-like transformations as inner loops to
    compute eigenpairs that are highly accurate and ``faithful'' to the
    various bidiagonal representations. Orthogonality of the eigenvectors
    is a consequence of this accuracy. Only $O(n)$ work per eigenpair is
    neede by our new algorithm.
    
    Conventional wisdom is that there is usually a trade-off between speed
    and accuracy in numerical procedures, i.e., higher accuracy can be
    achieved only at the expense of greater computing time. An interesting
    aspect of our work is that increased accuracy in the eigenvalues and
    eigenvectors obviates the need for explicit orthogonalization and
    leads to greater speed.
    
    We present timing and accuracy results comparing a computer
    implementation of our new algorithm with four existing EISPACK and
    LAPACK software routines. Our test-bed contains a variety of
    tridiagonal matrices, some coming from quantum chemistry
    applications. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of
    our new algorithm. For example, on a matrix of order 966 that occurs in
    the modeling of a biphenyl molecule our method is about 10 times
    faster than LAPACK's inverse iteration on a serial IBM RS/6000
    processor and nearly 100 times faster on a 128 processor IBM SP2
    parallel machine."

    creating and performing the updates, which prohibit the efficient use

    recursive algorithm that outperforms the LAPACK algorithm DGEQRF by
    about 20\% for large square matrices up to almost a factor of 3 for
    tall thin matrices. Uniprocessor performance results are presented for

    simplify expressions. These identities, which very likely seemed
    universally true to the programmers in the heat of writing the CAS
    (and often were true in well-known abstract algebraic domains) later
    neede re-examination when such systems were extended for dealing with
    kinds of objects unanticipated in the original design. These new
    objects are generally introduced to the CAS by extending
    ``generically'' the arithmetic of other operations. For example,
    approximate floats do not have the mathematical properties of exact
    integers or rationals. Complex numbers may strain a system designed
    for real-valued variables. In the situation examined here, we consider
    two categories of ``extended'' numbers: $\infty$ and {\sl undefined},
    and real intervals. We comment on issues raised by these two
    troublesome notions, how their introduction into a computer algebra
    system may require a (sometimes painful) reconsideration and redesign
    of parts of the program, and how they are related. An alternative
    (followed most notably by the Axiom system is to essentially envision
    a ``meta'' CAS defined in terms of categories and inheritance with
    only the most fundamental built-in concepts; from these one can build
    many variants of specific CAS features. This approach is appealing but
    can fail to accommodate extensions that violate some mathematical
    tenets in the cause of practicality."

    "Bisection is one of the most common methods used to compute the
    eigenvalues of symmetric tridiagonal matrices. Bisection relies on the
    {\sl Sturm count}: for a given shift $\sigma$, the number of negative
    pivots in the factorization $T-\sigma{}I=LDL^T$ equals the number of
    eigenvalues of $T$ that are smaller than $\sigma$. In IEEE-754
    arithmetic, the value $\infty$ permits the computation to continue
    past a zero pivot, producing a correct Sturm count when $T$ is
    unreduced. Demmel and Li showed in the 90s that using $\infty$ rather
    than testing for zero pivots within the loop could improve performance
    significantly on certain architectures.
    
    When eigenvalues are to be computed to high relative accuracy, it is
    often preferable to work with $LDL^T$ factorizations instead of the
    original tridiagonal $T$, see for example the MRRR algorithm. In these
    cases, the Sturm count has to be computed from $LDL^T$. The
    differential stationary and progressive qds algorithms are the method
    of choice.
    
    While it seems trivial to replace $T$ by $LDL^T$, in reality these
    algorithms are more complicated: in IEEE-754 arithmetic, a zero pivot
    produces an overflow, followed by an invalid exception (NaN), that
    renders the Sturm count incorrect.
    
    We present alternative, safe formulations that are guaranteed to
    produce the correct result.
    
    Benchmarking these algorithms on a variety of platforms shows that the
    original formulation without tests is always faster provided no
    exception occurs. The transforms see speed-ups of up to 2.6x over the
    careful formulation.
    
    Tests on industrial matrices show that encountering exceptions in
    practice is rare. This leads to the following design: First, compute
    the Sturm count by the fast but unsafe algorithm. Then, if an
    exception occured, recompute the count by a safe, slower alternative.
    
    The new Sturm count algorithms improve the speed of bisection by up to
    2x on our test matrices. Furthermore, unlike the traditional
    tiny-pivot substitutions, proper use of IEEE-754 features provides a
    careful formulation that imposed no input range restrictions."

    A four-parameter fit is developed for the class of integrals known as
    the exponential integral (real branch). Unlike other fits that are
    piecewise in nature, the current fit to the exponential integral is
    valid over the complete domain of the function (compact) and is
    everywhere accurate to within $\pm 0.0052\%$ when evaluating the first
    exponential integral, $E_1$. To achieve this result, a methodology
    that makes use of analytically known limiting behaviors at either
    extreme of the domain is employed. Because the fit accurately captures
    limiting behaviors of the $E_1$ function, more accuracy is retained
    when the fit is used as part of the scheme to evaluate higher-order
    exponential integrals, $E_n$, as compared with the use of brute-force
    fits to $E_1$, which fail to accurately model limiting
    behaviors. Furthermore, because the fit is compact, no special
    accommodations are required (as in the case of spliced piecewise fits)
    to smooth the value, slope, and higher derivatives in the transition
    region between two piecewise domains. The general methodology employed
    to develop this fit is outlined, since it may be used for other

    This thesis is concerned with calculating polynomial greatest common

    In the Introduction chapter, we introduce the problem and describe

    about some of the general subjects central to the thesis, terminating
    with a synopsis of the category theory which is central to the Axiom
    computer algebra system used during this research.

    The second chapter is devoted to describing category theory. We follow
    with a chapter detailing the important sections of computer code
    written in order to investigate the straight line program subject.
    The following chapter on evalution strategies and algorithms which are
    dependant on these follows, the major algorith which is dependant on
    evaluation and which is central to our theis being that of equality
    checking. This is indeed central to many mathematical problems.
    Interpolation, that is the determination of coefficients of a
    polynomial is the subject of the next chapter. This is very important
    for many straight line program algorithms, as their non-canonical
    structure implies that it is relatively difficult to determine
    coefficients, these being the basic objects that many algorithms work
    on. We talk about three separate interpolation techniques and compare
    their advantages and disadvantages. The final two chapters describe
    some of the results we have obtained from this research and finally
    conclusions we have drawn as to the viability of the straight line
    program approach and possible extensions.

    We assess the current state of research in the application of computer
    aided formal reasoning to computer algebra, and argue that embedded
    verification support allows users to enjoy its benefits without
    wrestling with technicalities. We illustrate this claim by considering
    symbolic definite integration, and present a verifiable symbolic
    definite integral table look up: a system which matches a query
    comprising a definite integral with parameters and side conditions,
    against an entry in a verifiable table and uses a call to a library of
    lemmas about the reals in the theorem prover PVS to aid in the
    transformation of the table entry into an answer. We present the full
    model of such a system as well as a description of our prototype
    implementation showing the efficacy of such a system: for example, the
    prototype is able to obtain correct answers in cases where computer
    algebra systems [CAS] do not. We extend upon Fateman's web-based table

    The algebraic hierarchy that is described here is both abstract and
    structured. Structures like groups and rings are port of it in an
    abstract way, defining e.g. a ring as a tuple consisting of a group, a
    binary operation and a constant that together satisfy the properties
    of a ring. In this way, a ring automatically inherits the group
    properties of the additive subgroup. The algebraic hierarchy is
    formalized in Coq by applying a combination of labeled record types
    and coercions. In the labeled record types of Coq, one can use 
    {\sl dependent types}: the type of one label may depend on another
    label. This allows to give a type to a dependent-typed tuple like
    $\langle A, f, a \rangle$, where $A$ is a set, $f$ an operation on $A$
    and $a$ an element of $A$. Coercions are functions that are used
    implicitly (they are inferred by the type checker) and allow, for
    example, to use the structure $\mathcal{A} := \langle A, f, a \rangle$
    as a synonym or the carrier set $A$, as is often done in mathematical
    practice. Apart rom the inheritance and reuse of properties, the
    algebraic hierarchy has proven very useful for reusing notations."

    This thesis describes substantial enhancements that were made to the
    software tools in the Nuprl system that are used to interactively
    guide the production of formal proofs. Over 20,000 lines of code were
    written for these tools. Also, a corpus of formal mathematics was
    created that consists of roughly 500 definitions and 1300
    theorems. Much of this material is of a foundational nature and
    supports all current work in Nuprl. This thesis concentrates on
    describing the half of this corpus that is concerned with abstract
    algebra and that covers topics central to the mathematics of the
    computations carried out by computer algebra systems.
    
    The new proof tools include those that solve linear arithmetic
    problems, those that apply the properties of order relations, those
    that carry out inductive proof to support recursive definitions, and
    those that do sophisticated rewriting. The rewrite tools allow
    rewriting with relations of differing strengths and take care of
    selecting and applying appropriate congruence lemmas automatically.
    The rewrite relations can be order relations as well as equivalence
    relations. If they are order relations, appropriate monotonicity
    lemmas are selected.
    
    These proof tools were heavily used throughout the work on
    computational algebra. Many examples are given that illustrate their
    operation and demonstrate their effectiveness.
    
    The foundation for algebra introduced classes of monoids, groups, ring
    and modules, and included theories of order relations and
    permutations.  Work on finite sets and multisets illustrates how a
    quotienting operation hides details of datatypes when reasoning about
    functional programs. Theories of summation operators were developed
    that drew indices from integer ranges, lists and multisets, and that
    summed over all the classes mentioned above. Elementary factorization
    theory was developed that characterized when cancellation monoids are
    factorial. An abstract data type for the operations of multivariate
    polynomial arithmetic was defined and the correctness of an
    implementation of these operations was verified. The implementation is
    similar to those found in current computer algebra systems.
    
    This work was all done in Nuprl's constructive type theory. The thesis
    discusses the appropriateness of this foundation, and the extent to
    which the work relied on it."

    The first step in the method presented in this paper is to transform a

    make repetition structures explicit by higher order functions, and
    after that rewrite the specification in the form of a Mealy
    Machine. Finally, adaptations have to be made in order to comply to
    the fixed nature of hardware. The result is then given to
    C$\lambda$aSH, a compiler which generates synthesizable VHDL from the
    resulting Haskell code. An advantage of the approach presented here is
    that in all phases of the process the design can be directly simulated
    by executing the defining code in a standard Haskell environment.

    "We present a new approach to automated reasoning about higher-order
    programs by endowing symbolic execution with a notion of higher-order,
    symbolic values.

    To validate our approach, we use it to develop and evaluate a system
    for verifying and refuting behavioral software contracts of components
    in a functional language, which we call {\sl soft contract
    verification}. In doing so, we discover a mutually beneficial relation
    between behavioral contracts and higher-order symbolic
    execution. Contracts aid symbolic execution by providing a rich
    language of specifications that can serve as the basis of symbolic
    higher-order values; the theory of blame enables modular verification
    and leads to the theorem that {\sl verified compnents can't be
    blamed}; and the run-time monitoring of contracts enables {\sl soft}
    verification whereby verified and unverified components can safely
    interact and verification is not an all-or-nothing
    proposition. Conversely, symbolic execution aids contracts by
    providing compile-time verification which increases assurance and
    enables optimizations; automated test-case generation for contracts
    with counter-examples; and engendering a virtuous cycle between
    verification and the gradual spread of contracts.

    Our system uses higher-order symbolic execution, leveraging contracts
    as a source of symbolic values including unknown behavioral values,
    and employs an updatable heap of contract invariants to reason about
    flow-sensitive facts. Whenever a contract is refuted, it reports a
    concrete {\sl counterexample} reproducing the error, which may involve
    solving for an unknown function. The approach is able to analyze
    first-class contracts, recursive data structures, unknown functions,
    and control-flow-sensitive refinement of values, which are all
    idiomatic in dynamic languages. It makes effective use of an
    off-the-shelf solver to decide problems without heavy encodings. Our
    counterexample search is sound and relatively complete with respect to
    a first-order solver for base type values. Therefore, it can form the
    basis of automated verification and bug-finding tools for higher-order
    programs. The approach is competitive with a wide range of existing
    tools -- including type systems, flow analyzers, and model checkers --
    on their own benchmarks. We have built a tool which analyzes programs
    written in Racket, and report on its effectiveness in verifying and
    refuting contracts."

    The use of computer algebra is usually considered beneficial for
    mechanised reasoning in mathematical domains. We present a case study,
    in the application domain of coding theory, that supports this claim:
    the mechanised proofs depend on non-trivial algorithms from computer
    algebra and increase the reasoning power of the theorem prover.

    The unsoundness of computer algebra systems is a major problem in
    interfacing them to theorem provers. Our approach to obtaining a sound
    overall system is not blanket distrust but based on the distinction
    between algorithms we call sound and {\sl ad hoc} respectively. This
    distinction is blurred in most computer algebra systems. Our
    experimental interface therefore uses a computer algebra library. It
    is based on formal specifications for the algorithms, and links the
    computer algebra library Sumit to the prover Isabelle.

    We give details of the interface, the use of the computer algebra
    system on the tactic-level of Isabelle and its integration into proof
    procedures."

  abstract = "
    Functional programmers often reason about programs as if they were
    written in a total language, expecting the results to carry over to
    non-toal (partial) languages. We justify such reasoning.

    Two languages are defined, one total and one partial, with identical
    syntax. The semantics of the partial language includes partial and
    infinite values, and all types are lifted, including the function
    spaces. A partial equivalence relation (PER) is then defined, the
    domain of which is the total subset of the partial language. For types
    not containing function spaces the PER relates equal values, and
    functions are related if they map related values to related values.

    It is proved that if two closed terms have the same semantics in the
    total language, then they have related semantics in the partial
    language. It is also shown that the PER gives rise to a bicartesian
    closed category which can be used to reason about values in the domain
    of the relation."

    In considering the reliability of numerical programs, it is normal to
    ``limit our study to the semantics dealing with numerical precision''.
    On the other hand, there is a great deal of work on the reliability of
    programs that essentially ignores the numerics. The thesis of this
    paper is that there is a class of problems that fall between these
    two, which could be described as ``does the low-level arithmetic
    implement the high-level mathematics''. Many of these problems arise
    because mathematics, particularly the mathematics of the complex
    numbers, is more difficult than expected: for example the complex
    function log is not continuous, writing down a program to compute an
    inverse function is more complicated than just solving an equation,
    and many algebraic simplification rules are not universally valid.

    The good news is that these problems are {\sl theoretically} capable
    of being solved, and are {\sl practically} close to being solved, but
    not yet solved, in several real-world examples. However, there is
    still a long way to go before implementations match the theoretical

    Computer algebra systems typically drop some degenerate cases when

    provides a powerful tool for heuristically reducing the combinatorial

    undertaken a project to build a translator from LLVM to the

    prover. Our translator produces executable ACL2 formal models,
    allowing us to both prove theorems about the translated models as well
    as validate those models by testing.  The resulting models can be
    translated and certified without user intervention, even for code with
    loops, thanks to the use of the def::ung macro which allows us to
    defer the question of termination. Initial measurements of concrete
    execution for translated LLVM functions indicate that performance is
    nearly 2.4 million LLVM instructions per second on a typical laptop
    computer. In this paper we overview the translation process and
    illustrate the translator's capabilities by way of a concrete example,

    In order to find subtle bugs in a system design, it is necessary to
    have a precise description of that design. There are at least two
    major benefits to writing a precise design; the author is forced to
    think more clearly, which helps eliminate ``plausible hand-waving'',
    and tools can be applied to check for errors in the design, even while
    it is being written. In contrast, conventional design documents
    consist of prose, static diagrams, and perhaps pseudo-code in an ad
    hoc untestable language. Such descriptions are far from precise; they
    are often ambiguous, or omit critical aspects such as partial failure
    or the granularity of concurrency (i.e. which constructs are assumed
    to be atomic). At the other end of the spectrum, the final executable
    code is unambiguous, but contains an overwhelming amount of detail. We
    needed to be able to capture the essence of a design in a few hundred
    lines of precise description. As our designs are unavoidably complex,
    we need a highly-expressive language, far above the level of code, but
    with precise semantics. That expressivity must cover real-world
    concurrency and fault-tolerance. And, as we wish to build services

    Programming languages such as Common Lisp, and virtually every
    computer algebra system (CAS), support exact arbitrary-precision
    integer arithmetic as well as exect rational number computation.
    Several CAS include interval arithmetic directly, but not in the
    extended form indicated here. We explain why changes to the usual
    rational number system to include infinity and ``not-a-number'' may be
    useful, especially to support robust interval computation. We describe
    techniques for implementing these changes."

    "If we are willing to give up compatibility with IEEE 754 floats and
    design a number format with goals appropriate to 2016, we can achieve
    several goals simultaneously: Extremely high energy efficiency and
    information-per-bit, no penalty for decimal operations instead of
    binary, rigorous bounds on answers without the overly pessimistic
    bounds produced by interval methods, and unprecedented high speed up
    to some precision. This approach extends the ideas of unum arithmetic
    introduced two years ago by breaking completely from the IEEE
    float-type format, resulting in fixed bit size values, fixed execution
    time, no exception values or 'gradual underflow' issues, no wasted bit
    patterns, and no redundant representations (like 'negative zero'). As
    an example of the power of this format, a difficult 12-dimensional
    nonlinear robotic kinematics problem that has defied solvers to date
    is quickly solvable with absolute bounds. Also unlike interval
    methods, it becomes possible to operate on arbitrary disconnected
    subsets of the real number line with the same speed as operating on a
    simple bound."

    Computer algebra systems often have to deal with piecewise continuous
    functions. These are, for example, the absolute value function,
    signum, piecewise defined functions but also functions that are the
    supremum or infimum of two functions. We present a new algebraic
    approach to these types of problems. This paper presents a normal form
    for a function ring containing piecewise polynomial functions of an
    expression. The main result is that this normal form can be used to
    decide extensional equality of two piecewise functions. Also we define
    supremum and infimum for piecewise functions; in fact, we show that
    the function ring forms a lattice. Additionally, a method to solve
    equalities and inequalities in this function ring is
    presented. Finally, we give a ``user interface'' to the algebraic
    representation of the piecewise functions."

    We extend a recent algorithm of Trager to a decision procedure for the
    indefinite integration of elementary functions. We can express the
    integral as an elementary function or prove that it is not
    elementary. We show that if the problem of integration in finite terms
    is solvable on a given elementary function field $k$, then it is
    solvable in any algebraic extension of $k(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is
    a logarithm or exponential of an element of $k$. Our proof considers
    an element of such an extension field to be an algebraic function of
    one variable over $k$.

    In his algorithm for the integration of algebraic functions, Trager
    describes a Hermite-type reduction to reduce the problem to an
    integrand with only simple finite poles on the associated Riemann
    surface. We generalize that technique to curves over liouvillian
    ground fields, and use it to simplify our integrands.  Once the
    multipe finite poles have been removed, we use the Puiseux expansions
    of the integrand at infinity and a generalization of the residues to

  abstract = "
    The general goal of this thesis is to investigate and develop computer
    algebra tools for the simplification resp. evaluation of definite
    integrals. One way of finding the value of a def- inite integral is
    via the evaluation of an antiderivative of the integrand. In the
    nineteenth century Joseph Liouville was among the first who analyzed
    the structure of elementary antiderivatives of elementary functions
    systematically. In the early twentieth century the algebraic structure
    of differential fields was introduced for modeling the differential
    properties of functions. Using this framework Robert H. Risch
    published a complete algorithm for transcendental elementary
    integrands in 1969. Since then this result has been extended to
    certain other classes of integrands as well by Michael F. Singer,
    Manuel Bronstein, and several others. On the other hand, if no
    antiderivative of suitable form is available, then linear relations
    that are satisfied by the parameter integral of interest may be found
    based on the principle of parametric integration (often called
    differentiating under the integral sign or creative telescoping).

    The main result of this thesis extends the results mentioned above to
    a complete algo- rithm for parametric elementary integration for a
    certain class of integrands covering a majority of the special
    functions appearing in practice such as orthogonal polynomials,
    polylogarithms, Bessel functions, etc. A general framework is provided
    to model those functions in terms of suitable differential fields. If
    the integrand is Liouvillian, then the present algorithm considerably
    improves the efficiency of the corresponding algorithm given by Singer
    et al. in 1985. Additionally, a generalization of Czichowski’s
    algorithm for computing the logarithmic part of the integral is
    presented. Moreover, also partial generalizations to include other
    types of integrands are treated.

    As subproblems of the integration algorithm one also has to find
    solutions of linear or- dinary differential equations of a certain
    type. Some contributions are also made to solve those problems in our
    setting, where the results directly dealing with systems of
    differential equations have been joint work with Moulay A. Barkatou.

    For the case of Liouvillian integrands we implemented the algorithm in
    form of our Mathematica package Integrator. Parts of the
    implementation also deal with more general functions. Our procedures
    can be applied to a significant amount of the entries in integral
    tables, both indefinite and definite integrals. In addition, our
    procedures have been successfully applied to interesting examples of
    integrals that do not appear in these tables or for which current
    standard computer algebra systems like Mathematica or Maple do not
    succeed. We also give examples of how parameter integrals coming from
    the work of other researchers can be solved with the software, e.g.,
    an integral arising in analyzing the entropy of certain processes."

  abstract = "
    Computing integrals is a common task in many areas of science,
    antiderivatives are one way to accomplish this.  The problem of
    integration in finite terms can be states as follows. Given a
    differential field $(F,D)$ and $f \in F$, compute $g$ in some
    elementary extension of $(F,D)$ such that $Dg = f$ if such a $g$
    exists.

    This problem has been solved for various classes of fields $F$.  For
    rational functions $(C(x), \frac{d}{dx})$ such a $g$ always exists and
    algorithms to compute it are known already for a long time. In 1969
    Risch published an algorithm that solves this problem when $(F,D)$ is
    a transcendental elementary extension of $(C(x),\frac{d}{dx})$. Later
    this has been extended towards integrands being Liouvillian functions
    by Singer et. al. via the use of regular log-explicit extensions of
    $(C(x),\frac{d}{dx})$. Our algorithm extends this to handling
    transcendental Liouvillian extensions $(F,D)$ of $(C,0)$ directly
    without the need to embed them into log-explicit extensions. For
    example, this means that
    \[\int{(z-x)x^{z-1}e^{-x}dx} = x^ze^{-x}\]
    can be computed without including log(x) in the differential field."

    In this thesis we cover some aspects of the theory necessary to obtain
    a canonical form for functions obtained by integration and
    exponentiation from the set of rational functions.

    These aspects include a new algorithm for symbolic integration of
    functions involving logarithms and exponentials which avoids
    factorization of polynomials in those cases where algebraic extension
    of the constant field is not required, avoids partial fraction
    decompositions, and only solves linear systems with a small number of
    unknowns.

    We have also found a theorem which states, roughly speaking, that if
    integrals which can be represented as logarithms are represented as
    such, the only algebraic dependence that a new exponential or
    logarithm can satify is given by the law of exponents or the law of
    logarithms."

    Symbolic integration is the problem of expressing an indefinite integral
    $\int{f}$ of a given function $f$ as a finite combination $g$ of elementary
    functions, or more generally, to determine whether a certain class of
    functions contains an element $g$ such that $g^\prime = f$.

    In the first part of this thesis, we compare different algorithms for
    symbolic integration. Specifically, we review the integration rules
    taught in calculus courses and how they can be used systematically to
    create a reasonable, but somewhat limited, integration method. Then we
    present the differential algebra required to prove the transcendental
    cases of Risch's algorithm. Risch's algorithm decides if the integral
    of an elementary function is elementary and if so computes it. The
    presentation is mostly self-contained and, we hope, simpler than
    previous descriptions of the algorithm. Finally, we describe
    Risch-Norman's algorithm which, although it is not a decision
    procedure, works well in practice and is considerably simpler than the
    full Risch algorithm.

    In the second part of this thesis, we briefly discuss an
    implementation of a computer algebra system and some of the
    experiences it has given us.  We also demonstrate an implementation of
    the rule-based approach and how it can be used, not only to compute
    integrals, but also to generate readable derivations of the results."

    Given a base field $k$, of characteristic zero, with effective

    symbolically with all the roots of a set of polynomials. One

    Previously presented symbolic algorithms concentrated on finding the

    finding an algebraic extension field of least degreee in which the

    In [5], we introduced an algorithm for deciding whether a proposed
    simplification of elementary functions was correct in the presence of
    branch cuts. This algorithm used multivalued function simplification
    followed by verification that the branches were consistent.

    In [14] an algorithm was presented for zero-testing functions defined
    by ordinary differential equations, in terms of their power series.

    The purpose of the current paper is to investigate merging the two
    techniques. In particular, we will show an explicit reduction to the
    constant problem [16]."

    There are many problems with the simplification of elementary
    functions, particularly over the complex plane, though not
    exclusively. Systems tend to make ``howlers'' or not to simplify
    enough. In this paper we outline the ``unwinding number'' approach to
    such problems, and show how it can be used to prevent errors and to
    systematise such simplification, even though we have not yet reduced
    the simplification process to a complete algorithm. The unsolved

    In computer algebra there are different ways of approaching the

    Although, formally, mathematics is clear that a function is a
    single-valued object, mathematical practice is looser, particularly
    with n-th roots and various inverse functions. In this paper, we point
    out some of the looseness, and ask what the implications are, both for
    Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation, of these practices.
    In doing so, we look at the steps necessary to convert existing tests
    into
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (a) rigorous statements
    \item (b) rigorously proved statements
    \end{itemize}
    In particular we ask whether there might be a constant ``de Bruij factor''

    depends greatly on the interpretation being placed on the symbols."

    In considering the reliability of numerical programs, it is normal to
    ``limit our study to the semantics dealing with numerical precision''.
    On the other hand, there is a great deal of work on the reliability of
    programs that essentially ignores the numerics. The thesis of this
    paper is that there is a class of problems that fall between the two,
    which could be described as ``does the low-level arithmetic implement
    the high-level mathematics''. Many of these problems arise because
    mathematics, particularly the mathematics of the complex numbers, is
    more difficult than expected; for example the complex function log is
    not continuous, writing down a program to compute an inverse function
    is more complicated than just solving an equation, and many algebraic
    simplification rules are not universally valid.

    The good news is that these problems are theoretically capable of
    being solved, and are practically close to being solved, but not yet
    solved, in several real-world examples. However, there is still a long
    way to go before implementations match the theoretical possibilities."

    We assume some standard choices for the branch cuts of a group of
    functions and consider the problem of then calculating the branch cuts

    in computer algebra systems. While the defining choices are usually
    simple (typically portions of either the real or imaginary axes) the
    cuts induced by the expression may be surprisingly complicated. We
    have made explicit and implemented techniques for calculating the cuts
    in the computer algebra programme Maple. We discuss the issues raised,
    classifying the different cuts produced. The techniques have been
    gathered in the BranchCuts package, along with tools for visualising
    the cuts. The package is included in Maple 17 as part of the

    Once it is decided that a CAS will evaluate multivalued functions on
    their principal branches, questions arise concerning the branch
    definitions. The first questions concern the standardization of the
    positions of the branch cuts. These questions have largely been
    resolved between the various algebra systems and the numerical
    libraries, although not completely. In contrast to the computer
    systems, many mathematical textbooks are much further behind: for
    example, many popular textbooks still specify that the argument of a
    complex number lies between 0 and $2\pi$. We do not intend to discuss

    Our algorithm is based on Yun's square-free factorization algorithm

    We will show that the modular approach presented by Yun has no

    algorithm is also simpler to implement and it can rely on any existing
    GCD algorithm without having to worry about choosing ``good'' evaluation

    To demonstrate this, we present some timings using implementations in
    Maple (Char et al. 1991), where the new algorithm is used for Release
    4 onwards, and Axiom (Jenks and Sutor, 1992) which is the only system

    Previously known algorithms for polynomial square-free decomposition

    coefficient domain where the decomposition is to be performed. In
    particular, gcd of the given polynomial and its first derivative (with

    less time than a single gcd between the given polynomial and its first

    homomorphic images of the desired square-free decomposition
    first. This provides information as to how many different square-free
    factors there are, their multiplicities and their homomorphic
    images. Since the multiplicities are known, only the square-free

    There are implementations of the celebrated Gosper algorithm (1978) on

    implemented Karr's Summation Algorithm (1981) based on difference
    field theory in the Mathematica system. Karr's algorithm is, in a

    forms for a big clas of multisums, we developed new extensions to
    handle also definite summation problems. More precisely we are able to
    apply creative telescoping in a very general difference field setting
    and are capable of solving linear recurrences in its context.

    Besides this we find significant new insights in symbolic summation by
    rephrasing the summation problems in the general difference field
    setting. In particular, we designed algorithms for finding appropriate
    difference field extensions to solve problems in symbolic summation.
    For instance we deal with the problem to find all nested sum
    extensions which provide us with additional solutions for a given
    linear recurrence of any order. Furthermore we find appropriate sum
    extensions, if they exist, to simplify nested sums to simpler nested
    sum expressions. Moreover we are able to interpret creative
    telescoping as a special case of sum extensions in an indefinite
    summation problem. In particular we are able to determine sum
    extensions, in case of existence, to reduce the order of a recurrence
    for a definite summation problem."

    in indefinite nested syms and products (Karr, 1981), but also over

    "The main result of this thesis is an effective method to extend Karr's
    symbolic summation framework to algebraic extensions. These arise, for
    example, when working with expressions involving $(-1)^n$. An
    implementation of this method, including a modernised version of
    Karr's algorithm is presented.

    Karr's algorithm is the summation analogue of the Risch algorithm for
    indefinite integration. In the summation case, towers of specialized
    difference fields called $\prod\sum$-fields are used to model nested
    sums and products. This is similar to the way elementary functions
    involving nested logarithms and exponentials are represented in
    differential fields in the integration case.

    In contrast to the integration framework, only transcendental
    extensions are allowed in Karr's construction. Algebraic extensions of
    $\prod\sum$-fields can even be rings with zero divisors. Karr's
    methods rely heavily on the ability to solve first-order linear
    difference equations and they are no longer applicable over these
    rings.

    Based on Bronstein's formulation of a method used by Singer for the
    solution of differential equations over algebraic extensions, we
    transform a first-order linear equation over an algebraic extension to
    a system of first-order equations over a purely transcendental
    extension field. However, this domain is not necessarily a
    $\prod\sum$-field. Using a structure theorem by Singer and van der
    Put, we reduce this system to a single first-order equation over a
    $\prod\sum$-field, which can be solved by Karr's algorithm. We also
    describe how to construct towers of difference ring extensions on an
    algebraic extension, where the same reduction methods can be used.

    A common bottleneck for symbolic summation algorithms is the
    computation of nullspaces of matrices over rational function
    fields. We present a fast algorithm for matrices over $\mathbb{Q}(x)$
    which uses fast arithmetic at the hardware level with calls to BLAS
    subroutines after modular reduction. This part is joint work with Arne
    Storjohann."

    We seek to understand a general method for finding a closed form for a

    integral has an antiderivative. Once an antidifference is found, then
    given the limits of the sum, it suffices to evaluate the
    antidifference at the given limits. Several algorithms (by Karr and
    Schneider) exist to find antidifferences, but the apers describing
    these algorithms leave out several of the key proofs needed to
    implement the algorithms. We attempt to fill in these gaps and find
    that many of the steps to solve difference equations rely on being
    able to solve two problems: the equivalence problem and the homogenous
    group membership problem. Solving these two problems is essential to
    finding the polynomial degree bounds and denominator bounds for

    One of the problems with manipulating function identities in computer
    algebra systems is that they often involve functions which are
    multivalued, whilst most users tend to work with single-valued
    functions.  The problem is that many well-known identities may no
    longer be true everywhere in the complex plane when working with their
    single-valued counterparts. Conversely, we cannot ignore them, since
    in particular contexts they may be valid. We investigate the
    practicality of a method to verify such identities by means of an
    experiment; this is based on a set of test examples which one might
    realistically meet in practice.  Essentially, the method works as
    follows. We decompose the complex plane via means of cylindrical
    algebraic decomposition into regions with respect to the branch cuts
    of the functions. We then test the identity numerically at a sample
    point in the region. The latter step is facilitated by the notion of
    the {\sl adherence} of a branch cut, which was previously introduced
    by the authors. In addition to presenting the results of the
    experiment, we explain how adherence relates to the proposal of 
    {\sl signed zeros} by W. Kahan, and develop this idea further in order to
    allow us to cover previously untreatable cases. Finally, we discuss
    other ways to improve upon our general methodology as well as topics

    "The McCallum Projection for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD)
    produces a smaller projection factor set than previous projections,
    however it does not always produce a sign-invariant CAD for the set of
    input polynomials. Problems may arise when a ($k+1$)-level projection
    factor vanishes identically over a k-level cell. According to
    McCallum's paper, when this happens (and $k+1$ is not the highest
    level in the CAD) we do not know whether the projection is valid,
    i.e. whether or not a sign-invariant CAD for the set of input
    polynomials will be produced when lifting is performed in the usual
    way. When the $k$-level cell in question has dimension 0, McCallum
    suggests a modification of the lifting method that will ensure the
    validity of his projection, although to my knowledge this has never
    been implemented.

    In this paper we give easily computable criteria that often allow us
    to conclude that McCallum's projection is valid even though a
    projection factor vanishes identically over a cell. We also improve on
    McCallum's modified lifting method.

    We've incorporated the ideas contained in the paper into QEPCAD, the
    most complete implementation of CAD. When McCallum's projection is
    invalid because of a projection factor not being order-invariant over a
    region on which it vanishes identically, at least a warning message
    ought to be issued. Currently, QEPCAD may print warning messages that
    are not needed, and may fail to print warning messages when they are
    needed. Our implementation in QEPCAD ensures that warning messages are
    printed when needed, and reduces the number of times warning messages
    are printed when not needed. Neither McCallum's modified lifting
    method nor our improvement of it have been implemented in QEPCAD. The
    design of the system would make implementing such a feature quite

    This report introduces QEPCAD B, a program for computing with real
    algebraic sets using cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD). QEPCAD
    B both extends and improves upon the QEPCAD system for quantifier
    elimination by partial cylindrical algebraic decomposition written by
    Hoon Hong in the early 1990s. This paper briefly discusses some of the
    improvements in the implementation of CAD and quantifier elimination
    vis CAD, and provides somewhat more detail on extensions to the system
    that go beyond quantifier elimination. The author is responsible for
    most of the extended features of QEPCAD B, but improvements to the
    basic CAD implementation and to the SACLIB library on which QEPCAD is
    based are the results of many people's work."

    "We study polynomials of degree up to 4 over the rationals or a
    computable real subfield. Our motivation comes from the need to
    evaluate predicates in nonlinear computational geometry efficiently
    and exactly. We show a new method to compare real algebraic numbers by
    precomputing generalized Sturm sequences, thus avoiding iterative
    methods; the method, moreover handles all degenerate cases. Our first
    contribution is the determination of rational isolating points, as
    functions of the coefficients, between any pair of real roots. Our
    second contribution is to exploit invariants and Bezoutian
    subexpressions in writing the sequences, in order to reduce bit
    complexity. The degree of the tested quantities in the input
    coefficients is optimal for degree up to 3, and for degree 4 in
    certain cases. Our methods readily apply to real solving of pairs of
    quadratic equations, and to sign determination of polynomials over
    algebraic numbers of degree up to 4. Our third contribution is an
    implementation in a new module of library SYNAPS v2.1. It improves
    significantly upon the efficiency of certain publicly available
    implementations: Rioboo’s approach on AXIOM, the package of
    Guibas-Karavelas-Russel, and CORE v1.6, MAPLE v9, and SYNAPS
    v2.0. Some existing limited tests had shown that it is faster than
    commercial library LEDA v4.5 for quadratic algebraic numbers."

    When building a cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) savings can

    The present paper is concerned with how to use multiple ECs,
    propagating those in the input throughout the projection set. We
    improve on the approach of McCallum in ISSAC 2001 by using the reduced
    projection theory to make savings in the lifting phase (both to the
    polynomials we lift with and the cells lifted over). We demonstrate
    the benefits with worked examples and a complexity analysis."

    Real algebraic numbers appear in many Computer Algebra problems.  For
    instance the determination of a cylindrical algebraic decomposition
    for an euclidean space requires computing with real algebraic numbers.
    This paper describes an implementation for computations with the real
    roots of a polynomial. This process is designed to be recursively
    used, so the resulting domain of computation is the set of all real
    algebraic numbers. An implementation for the real algebraic closure

    multiple variables, standart trigonometric and exponential functions,
    various special functions for example gamma, zeta, Bessel, etc. and
    also arbitrary functions like derivatives, integrals, sums, and
    products of expressions. Our implementation of a CAS tool provides an
    object orienged design framework. The system is portable to other
    platforms and highly scalable. The other key features include a very
    simple and interactive user GUI support for a formula editor, making
    it a self contained system, additionally the formula editor provides a

    theorem prover through theory interpretation. They are available for
    the theorem prover Isabelle. In this paper, their semantics is defined
    in terms of local theories and morphisms. Locales aim at providing
    flexible means of extension and reuse. Theory modules (which are
    called locales) may be extended by definitions and
    theorems. Interpretation of Isabelle's global theories and proof
    contexts is possible via morphisms. Even the locale hierarchy may be
    changed if declared relations between locales do not adequately
    reflect logical relations, which are implied by the locales'
    specifications. By discussing their design and relating it to more
    commonly known structuring mechanisms of programming languages and
    provers, locales are made accessible to a wider audience beyond the
    users of Isabelle. The discussed mechanisms include ML-style functors,
    type classes and mixins (the latter are found in modern

    the sense that they are provably not an answer to the question
    posed. However, an answer can be mathematically right without being
    pedagogically right. Here we explore the differences and show that,

    by Shirshov which introduced the phrase ``rings that are nearly
    associative''. The first book in the English language devoted to a
    systematic study of nonassociative algebras is Schafer (Scha66). A
    comprehensive exposition of the work of the Russian School is
    Zhevlakov, Slinko, Shestakov and Shirshov. A collection of open
    research problems in algebra, including many problems on
    nonassociative algebra, is the {\sl Dniester Notebook}; the survey
    article by Kuzmin and Shetakov is from the same period. Three books on
    Jordan algebras which contain substantial material on general
    nonassociative algebras are Braun and Koecher, Jacobson, and
    McCrimmon. Recent research appears in the Proceedings of the
    International Conferences on Nonassociative Algebras and its
    Applications. The present section provides very limited information on
    Lie algebras, since they are the subject of Section 16.4. The last
    part (section 9) of the present section presents three applications of
    computational linear algebra to the study of polynomial identiies for
    nonassociative algebras: pseudorandom vectors in a nonassociative
    algebra, the expansion matrix for a nonassociative operation, and the
    representation theory of the symmetric group."

    Dynamic evaluation is a technique for producing multiple results
    according to a decision tree which evolves with program execution.
    Sometimes it is desired to produce results for all possible branches
    in the decision tree, while on other occasions, it may be sufficient
    to compute a single result which satisfies certain properties. This
    techinique finds use in computer algebra where computing the correct
    result depends on recognizing and properly handling special cases of
    parameters. In previous work, programs using dynamic evaluation have
    explored all branches of decision trees by repeating the computations
    prior to decision points.

    This paper presents two new implementations of dynamic evaluation
    which avoid recomputing intermediate results. The first approach uses
    Scheme ``continuations'' to record state for resuming program
    execution. The second implementation uses the Unix ``fork'' operation
    to form new processes to explore alternative branches in parallel."

    A number of recent programming language designs incorporate a type
    checking system based on the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic
    $\lambda$-calculus.  This allows the construction of general purpose,
    reusable software without sacrificing compile-time type checking. A
    major factor constraining the implementation of these languages is the
    difficulty of automatically inferring the lengthy type information
    that is otherwise required if full use is made of these
    languages. There is no known algorithm to solve any natural and fully
    general formulation of the ``type inference'' problem. One very
    reasonable formulation of the problem is known to be undecidable.

    Here we define a restricted version of the type inference problem and
    present an efficient algorithm for its solution. We argue that the
    restriction is sufficiently weak to be unobtrusive in practice."

    It is well-known that few object-oriented programming languages allow
    objects to change their nature at run-time. There have been a number

    object-oriented programming languages to reflect the dynamic nature of
    problems, particularly those arising in a mathematical context. It is
    from this context that we present a framework that realistically
    represents the dynamic and evolving characteristic of problems and

    "Around 1980 two new directions in science and technique came
    together. One was Buchberger’s algorithms in order to handle Groebner
    bases in an effective way for solving polynomial equations. The second
    one was the development of the personal computers. This was the
    starting point of a computational perspective in commutative algebra
    and algebraic geometry. In 1991 the three authors invented the first
    edition of their book as an introduction for undergraduates to some
    interesting ideas in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry with a
    strong perspective to practical and computational aspects. A second
    revised edition appeared in 1996. That means from the very beginning
    the book provides a bridge for the new, computational aspects in the
    field of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

    To be more precise, the book gives an introduction to Buchberger’s
    algorithm with applications to syzygies, Hilbert polynomials, primary
    decompositions. There is an introduction to classical algebraic
    geometry with applications to the ideal membership problem, solving
    polynomial equations, and elimination theory. Some more spectacular
    applications are about robotics, automatic geometric theorem proving,
    and invariants of finite groups. It seems to the reviewer to carry
    coals to Newcastle for estimating the importance and usefulness of the
    book. It should be of some interest to ask how many undergraduates
    have been introduced to algorithmic aspects of commutative algebra and
    algebraic geometry following the line of the book. The reviewer will
    be sure that this will continue in the future too.  

    What are the changes to the previous editions? There is a significant
    shorter proof of the Extension Theorem, see 3.6 in Chapter 3,
    suggested by A.H.M. Levelt. A major update has been done in Appendix C
    ``Computer Algebra Systems''. This concerns in the main the section
    about MAPLE. Some minor updated information concern the use of AXIOM,
    CoCoA, Macaulay2, Magma, Mathematica, and SINGULAR. This reflects
    about the recent developments in Computer Algebra Systems. It
    encourages an interested reader to more practical exercises. The
    authors have made changes on over 200 pages to enhance clarity and
    correctness. Many individuals have reported typographical errors and
    gave the authors feedback on the earlier editions. The book is
    well-written. The reviewer guesses that it will become more and more
    difficult to earn 1 dollar (sponsored by the authors) for every new
    typographical error as it was the case also with the first and second
    edition. The reviewer is sure that it will be a excellent guide to
    introduce further undergraduates in the algorithmic aspect of
    commutative algebra and algebraic geometry."

    fact, we seldom explore it in detail, and tend to regard it as
    trivial. When it is shown to be non-trivial, we are often
    surprised. As is often the case, the computerization of
    mathematical computation in computer algebra systems on the one
    hand, and mathematical reasoning in theorem provers on the other
    hand, forces us to explore the issue of equality in greater
    detail.In practice, there are also several ambiguities in the
    definition of equality. For example, we refer to $\mathbb{Q}(x)$
    as ``rational functions'', even though $\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ and
    $x+1$ are not equal as functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to
    $\mathbb{R}$, since the former is not defined at $x=1$, even
    though they are equal as elements of $\mathbb{Q}(x)$. The aim of
    this paper is to point out some of the problems, both with
    mathematical equality and with data structure equality, and to
    explain how necessary it is to keep a clear distintion between the
    two."

    This paper explains how Scratchpad solves the problem of presenting a
    categorical view of factorization in unique factorization domains,
    i.e.  a view which can be propagated by functors such as
    SparseUnivariatePolynomial or Fraction. This is not easy, as the
    constructive version of the classical concept of
    UniqueFactorizationDomain cannot be so propagated. The solution
    adopted is based largely on Seidenberg's conditions (F) and (P), but
    there are several additional points that have to be borne in mind to
    produce reasonably efficient algorithms in the required generality.

    The consequence of the algorithms and interfaces presented in this
    paper is that Scratchpad can factorize in any extension of the
    integers or finite fields by any combination of polynomial, fraction
    and algebraic extensions: a capability far more general than any other
    computer algebra system possesses. The solution is not perfect: for
    example we cannot use these general constructions to factorize
    polyinmoals in $\overline{Z[\sqrt{-5}]}[x]$ since the domain
    $Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a unique factorization domain, even though
    $\overline{Z[\sqrt{-5}]}$ is, since it is a field. Of course, we can
    factor polynomials in $\overline{Z}[\sqrt{-5}][x]$"

  abstract = "
    Computer algebra systems are large collections of routines for solving
    mathematical problems algorithmically, efficiently and above all,
    symbolically. The more advanced and rigorous computer algebra systems
    (for example, Axiom) use the concept of strong types based on
    order-sorted algebra and category theory to ensure that operations are
    only applied to expressions when they ``make sense''.

    In cases where Axiom uses notions which are not covered by current
    mathematics we shall present new mathematics which will allow us to
    prove that all such cases are reducible to cases covered by the
    current theory. On the other hand, we shall also point out all the
    cases where Axiom deviates undesirably from the mathematical ideal.
    Furthermore we shall propose solutions to these deviations.

    Strongly typed systems (especially of mathematics) become unusable
    unless the system can change the type in a way a user expects. We wish
    any change expected by a user to be automated, ``natural'', and
    unique. ``Coercions'' are normally viewed as ``natural type changing
    maps''. This thesis shall rigorously define the word ``coercion'' in
    the context of computer algebra systems.

    We shall list some assumptions so that we may prove new results so
    that all coercions are unique. This concept is called ``coherence''.

    We shall give an algorithm for automatically creating all coercions in
    type system which adheres to a set of assumptions. We shall prove that
    this is an algorithm and that it always returns a coercion when one
    exists. Finally, we present a demonstration implementation of this
    automated coerion algorithm in Axiom."

    the framework is the notion of a biform theory which is simultaneously
    an axiomatic theory and an algorithmic theory. Representing a
    collection of mathematical models, a biform theory provides a formal
    context for both deduction and computation. The framework includes
    facilities for deriving theorems via a mixture of deduction and
    computation, constructing sound deduction and computation rules, and
    developing networks of biform theories linked by interpretations. The
    framework is not tied to a specific underlying logic; indeed, it is
    intended to be used with several background logics
    simultaneously. Many of the ideas and mechanisms used in the framework
    are inspired by the IMPS Interactive Mathematical Proof System and the

    Some of the earliest computer algebra systems (CAS) looked like
    overloaded languages of the same era. FORMAC, PL/I FORMAC, Formula
    Algol, and others each took advantage of a pre-existing language base
    and expanded the notion of a numeric value to include mathematical
    expressions. Much more recently, perhaps encouraged by the growth in
    popularity of C++, we have seen a renewal of the use of overloading to
    implement a CAS.

    This paper makes three points. 1. It is easy to do overloading in
    Common Lisp, and show how to do it in detail. 2. Overloading per se
    provides an easy solution to some simple programming problems. We show
    how it can be used for a ``demonstration'' CAS. Other simple and
    plausible overloadings interact nicely with this basic system. 3. Not
    all goes so smoothly: we can view overloading as a case study and
    perhaps an object lesson since it fails to solve a number of
    fairly-well articulated and difficult design issues in CAS for which
    other approaches are preferable."

    One of the main strengths of computer algebra is being able to solve a
    family of problems with one computation. In order to express not only
    one problem but a family of problems, one introduces some symbols
    which are in fact the parameters common to all the problems of the
    family.

    The user must be able to understand in which way these parameters
    affect the result when he looks at the answer. Otherwise it may lead
    to completely wrong calculations, which when used for numerical
    applications bring nonsensical answers. This is the case in most
    current Computer Algebra Systems we know because the form of the
    answer is never explicitly conditioned by the values of the
    parameters. The user is not even informed that the given answer may be
    wrong in some cases then computer algebra systems can not be entirely
    trustworthy. We have introduced multi-valued expressions called {\sl
    conditional} expressions, in which each potential value is associated
    with a condition on some parameters. This is used, in particular, to
    capture the situation in integration, where the form of the answer can
    depend on whether certain quantities are positive, negative or
    zero. We show that it is also necessary when solving modular linear
    equations or deducing congruence conditions from complex expressions."

    syzygies. We present a method for obtaining a reduced, nearly minimal
    basis of that module. The simple procedure for detecting (redundant
    syzygies and )superfluous reductions is incorporated now in our
    installation of Buchberger's algorithm in SCRATCHPAD II and REDUCE
    3.3. The paper concludes with statistics stressing the good
    computational properties of these installations."

    This thesis presents an algorithm for computing (one-sided) limits
    within a symbolic manipulation system. Computing limtis is an
    important facility, as limits are used both by other functions such as
    the definite integrator and to get directly some qualitative
    information about a given function.

    The algorithm we present is very compact, easy to understand and easy
    to implement. It overcomes the cancellation problem other algorithms
    suffer from. These goals were achieved using a uniform method, namely
    by expanding the whole function into a series in terms of its most
    rapidly varying subexpression instead of a recursive bottom up
    expansion of the function. In the latter approach exact error terms
    have to be kept with each approximation in order to resolve the
    cancellation problem, and this may lead to an intermediate expression
    swell. Our algorithm avoids this problem and is thus suited to be
    implemented in a symbolic manipulation system."

    bases. Firstly, we present the two existing theories of involutive
    divisions, compare them, and come up with a generalised approach of
    {\sl suitable partial divisions}. The thesis is built on this
    generalized approach. Secondly, we treat the question of choosing a
    ``good'' suitable partial division in each iteration of the involutive
    basis algorithm. We devise an efficient and flexible algorithm for
    this purpose, the {\sl Sliced Division} algorithm. During the
    involutive basis algorithm, the Sliced Division algorithm contributes
    to an early detection of the involutive basis property and a
    minimisation of the number of critical elements. Thirdly, we give new
    criteria to avoid unnecessary reductions in an involutive basis
    algorithm. We show that the termination property of an involutive
    basis algorithm which applies our criteria is independent of the
    prolongation selection strategy used during its run. Finally, we
    present an implementation of the algorithm and results of this thesis

  school = "RISC Research Institute for Symbolic Computation",
  paper = "Hodo11.pdf",
  abstract =
    "In computer algebra, the problem of computing topological invariants
    (i.e. delta-invariant, genus) of a plan complex algebraic curve is
    well-understood if the coefficients of the defining polynomial of the
    curve are exact data (i.e. integer numbers or rational numbers). The
    challenge is to handle this problem if the coefficients are inexact
    (i.e. numerical values).

    In this thesis, we approach the algebraic problem of computing
    invariants of a plane complex algebraic curve defined by a polynomial
    with both exact and inexact data. For the inexact data, we associate a
    positive real number called {\sl tolerance} or {\sl noise}, which
    measures the error level in the coefficients. We deal with an {\sl
    ill-posed} problem in the sense that, tiny changes in the input data
    lead to dramatic modifications in the output solution.

    For handling the ill-posedness of the problem we present a {\sl
    regularization} method, which estimates the invariants of a plane
    complex algebraic curve. Our regularization method consists of a set
    of {\sl symbolic-numeric algorithms} that extract structural
    information on the input curve, and of a {\sl parameter choice rule},
    i.e. a function in the noise level. We first design the following
    symbolic-numeric algorithms for computing the invariants of a plane
    complex algebraic curve:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item we compute the link of each singularity of the curve by numerical
    equation solving
    \item we compute the Alexander polynomial of each link by using
    algorithms from computational geometry (i.e. an adapted version of
    the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm) and combinatorial objects from knot
    theory.
    \item we derive a formula for the delta-invariant and for the genus
    \end{itemize}

    We then prove that the symbolic-numeric algorithms together with the
    parameter choice rule compute approximate solutions, which satisfy the
    {\sl convergence for noisy data property}. Moreover, we perform
    several numerical experiments, which support the validity for the
    convergence statement.

    We implement the designed symbolic-numeric algorithms in a new
    software package called {\sl Genom3ck}, developed using the {\sl Axel}
    free algebraic modeler and the {\sl Mathemagix} free computer algebra
    system. For our purpose, both of these systems provide modern
    graphical capabilities, and algebraic and geometric tools for
    manipulating algebraic curves and surfaces defined by polynomials with
    both exact and inexact data. Together with its main functionality to
    compute the genus, the package {\sl Genom3ck} computes also other type
    of information on a plane complex algebraic curve, such as the
    singularities of the curve in the projective plane and the topological
    type of each singularity."

    under perturbations. The authors use the computer in the context of

    they apply Gröbner bases techniques and the theory of (formal) normal
    forms in the space of the coefficients of the jets of the

    "The problem of efficiently evaluating special functions to high
    precision has been considered by numerous authors. Important tools
    used for this purpose include algorithms for evaluation of linearly
    recurrent sequences, and algorithms for power series arithmetic.

    In this work, we give new baby-step, giant-step algorithms for
    evaluation of linearly recurrent sequences involving an expensive
    parameter (such as a high-precision real number) and for computing
    compositional inverses of power series. Our algorithms do not have the
    best asymptotic complexity, but they are faster than previous
    algorithms in practice over a large input range.

    Using a combination of techniques, we also obtain efficient new
    algorithms for numerically evaluating the gamma function $\Gamma(z)$
    and the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,a)$, or Taylor series
    expansions of those functions, with rigorous error bounds. Our methods
    achieve softly optimal complexity when computing a large number of
    derivatives to proportionally high precision.

    Finally, we show that isolated values of the integer partition
    function $p(n)$ can be computed rigorously with softly optimal
    complexity by means of the Hardy-Ramanugan-Rademacher formula and
    careful numerical evaluation.

    We provide open source implementations which run significantly faster
    than previous published software. The implementations are used for
    record computations of the partition function, including the
    tabulation of several billion Ramanujan-type congruences, and of
    Taylor series associated with the Reimann zeta function."

    resultants and factorization is part of the essential building blocks
    for any computation in algebraic geometry, in particular in automated
    deduction in geometry. There are various implementations of these
    algorithms in procedural programming languages. Our aim is an
    implementation in a modern object oriented language with generic data
    types, as it is provided by Java programming language. We exemplify
    that the type design and implementation of JAS is suitable for the
    implementation of several greatest common divisor algorithms and
    factorization of multivariate polynomials. Due to the design we can
    employ this package in very general settings not commonly seen in other
    computer algebra systems. As for example, in the coefficient
    arithmetic for advanced Groebner basis computations like in polynomial
    rings over rational function fields or (finite, commutative) regular
    rings. The new package provides factory methods for the selection of
    one of the several implementations for non experts. Further we

    Algebraic Topology, is one of Sergeraert’s systems for effective
    homology and homotopy computation.) This characterization was
    established using classical tools, in an unrelated way to the current
    mainstream topics in the field of algebraic specifications. Looking
    for a connection with these topics, we have found, rather
    unexpectedly, that our approach is related to some object-oriented
    formalisms, namely hidden specifications and the coalgebraic view. In
    this paper, we explore these relations making explicit the implicit
    object-oriented features of the EAT system and generalizing the data
    structure analysis we had previously done."

    "One way in which mathematicians deal with infinite amounts of data is
    symbolic representation. A simple example is the quadratic equation
    \[x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]
    a formula which uses symbolic representation to describe the solutions
    to an infinite class of equations. Most computer algebra systems can
    deal with polynomials with symbolic coefficients, but what if symbolic
    exponents are called for (e.g. $1+t^i$)? What if symbolic limits on
    summations are also called for, for example
    \[1+t+\ldots+t^i=\sum_j{t^j}\]

    The ``Scratchpad Concept'' is a theoretical ideal which allows the
    implementation of objects at this level of abstraction and beyond in a
    mathematically consistent way. The Axiom computer algebra system is an
    implementation of a major part of the Scratchpad Concept.  Axiom
    (formerly called Scratchpad) is a language with extensible
    parameterized types and generic operators which is based on the
    notions of domains and categories. By examining some aspects of the
    Axiom system, the Scratchpad Concept will be illustrated. It will be
    shown how some complex problems in homologicial algebra were solved
    through the use of this system."

    "Symbolic polynomial computation is widely used to solve many applied
    or abstract mathematical problems. Some of them, such as solving
    systems of polynomial equations, have exponential complexity. Their
    implementation is, therefore, a challenging task.

    By using adapted data structures, asymptotically fast algorithms and
    effective code optimization techniques, we show how to reduce the
    practical and theoretical complexity of these computations. Our effort
    is divided into three categories: integrting the best known techniques
    into our implementation, investigating new directions, and measuring
    the interactions between numerous techniques.

    We chose AXIOM and ALDOR as our implementation and experimentation
    environment, since they are both strongly typed and highly efficient
    Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). Our implementation results show that
    our methods have great potential to improve the efficiency of exact
    polynomial computations with the selected CASs. The performance of our
    implementation is comparable to that of (often outperforming) the best
    available packages for polynomial computations."

    further take advantage of the features of lower level languages, such
    as their specialized data structures or direct access to machine
    arithmetic. Whereas, other polynomial operations, like Groebner basis
    over an arbitrary field, are suitable for generic programming in a
    high-level language.

    We are interested in the integration of polynomial data type
    implementations realized at different language levels, such as Lisp, C
    and Assembly. In particular, we consider situations for which code
    from different levels can be combined together within the same
    application in order to achieve high-performance.  We have developed
    implementation techniques in the multiple-level programming
    environment provided by the computer algebra system AXIOM. For a given
    algorithm realizing a polynomial operation, available at the user
    level, we combine the strengths of each language level and the
    features of a specific machine architecture. Our experimentations show

    non-linear, algebraic or differential equations, is a fundamental
    problem in mathematical sciences. It has been studied for centuries
    and still stimulates many research developments, in particular on the
    front of high-performance computing.

    Triangular decompositions are a highly promising technique with the
    potential to produce high-performance polynomial system solvers. This
    thesis makes several contributions to this effort.

    We propose asymptotically fast algorithms for the core operati ons on
    which triangular decompositions rely. Complexity results and comparati
    ve implementation show that these new algorithms provide substantial
    performance improvements.

    We present a fundamental software library for polynomial arithmetic in
    order to support the implementation of high-performance solvers based
    on triangular decompositions. We investigate strategies for the
    integration of this library in high-level programming environments
    where triangular decompositions are usually implemented.

    We obtain a high performance library combining highly optimized C
    routines and solving procedures written in the Maple computer algebra
    system. The experimental result shows that our approaches are very
    effective, since our code often outperforms pre-existing solvers in a

    This paper investigates some soundness conditions which have to be
    fulfilled in systems with coercions and generic operators. A result of
    Reynolds on unrestricted generic operators is extended to generic
    operators which obey certain constraints. We get natural conditions
    for such operators, which are expressed within the theoretic framework
    of category theory. However, in the context of computer algebra, there
    arise examples of coercions and generic operators which do not fulfil
    these conditions. We describe a framework -- relaxing the above
    conditions -- that allows distinguishing between cases of ambiguities
    which can be resolved in a quite natural sense and those which
    cannot. An algorithm is presented that detects such unresolvable
    ambiguities in expressions."

    "A common way of implementing multivariate polynomial multiplication
    and division is to represent polynomials as linked lists of terms
    sorted in a term ordering and to use repeated merging. This results in
    poor performance on large sparse polynomials.

    In this paper we use an auxiliary heap of pointers to reduce the
    number of monomial comparisons in the worst case while keeping the
    overall storage linear. We give two variations. In the first, the size
    of the heap is bounded by the number of terms in the quotient(s). In
    the second, which is new, the size is bounded by the number of terms
    in the divisor(s).

    We use dynamic arrays of terms rather than linked lists to reduce
    storage allocations and indirect memory references. We pack monomials
    in the array to reduce storage and to speed up monomial
    comparisons. We give a new packing for the graded reverse
    lexicographical ordering.

    We have implemented the heap algorithms in C with an interface to
    Maple. For comparison we have also implemented Yan’s ``geobuckets'' data
    structure. Our timings demonstrate that heaps of pointers are
    comparable in speed with geobuckets but use significantly less
    storage."

    OpenMath is a widely recognized approach to the semantic markup of

    purpose of modelling mathematical structures, while the system itself

    of how one may perform translations from generic OpenMath objects into
    values in specific Aldor domains, describing how the Aldor interfae
    domain ExpresstionTree is used to achieve this. We outline our Aldor
    implementation of an OpenMath translator, and describe an efficient
    extention of this to the Parser category. In addition, the Aldor

    The authors develop an algorithm for the symbolic computation of

    this strategy could be adapted to other CASs and DGSs.

    This work clearly has a didactic application in geometric problems

    An introduction to the formal theory of partial differential equations

    values for the number of arbitrary functions in its general solution

    equations is proven.  Applications of these results include an
    analysis of symmetry and reduction methods and a study of gauge

    constraints is closely related to the completion of the equation of
    motion to an involutive equation. Specific examples treated comprise
    the Yang-Mills Equations, Einstein Equations, complete and Jacobian
    systems, and some special models in two and three dimensions. To

    This paper describes the design and implementation of an algorithmic
    differentiation framework in the Axiom computer algebra system. Our
    implementation works by transformations on Spad programs at the level
    of the typed abstract syntax tree -- Spad is the language for extending
    Axiom with libraries. The framework illustrates an algebraic theory
    of algorithmic differentiation, here only for Spad programs, but
    we suggest that the theory is general. In particular, if it is
    possible to define a compositional semantics for programs, we define
    the exact requirements for when a program can be algorithmically
    differentiated. This leads to a general algorithmic differentiation
    system, and is not confined to functions which compute with basic
    data types, such as floating point numbers."

    for a re-examination of the basic interfaces used for mathematical

    mathematics and take full advantage of their unique features to make
    practical a particularly flexible approach that was formerly thought
    to be infeasible. Thus, we address traditional proof engineering
    challenges as well as new ones resulting from our ambition to build
    upon this development a library of constructive analysis in which any
    abstraction penalties inhibiting efficient computation are reduced to
    a minimum.

    The basis of our development consists of type classes representing a
    standard algebraic hierarchy, as well as portions of category theory
    and universal algebra. On this foundation, we build a set of
    mathematically sound abstract interfaces for different kinds of
    numbers, succinctly expressed using categorical language and universal
    algebra constructions.

    Strategic use of type classes lets us support these high-level
    theory-friendly definitions, while still enabling efficient
    implementations unhindered by gratuitous indirection, conversion or
    projection.

    Algebra thrives on the interplay between syntax and semantics. The
    Prolog-like abilities of type class instance resolution allow us to
    conveniently define a quote function, thus facilitating the use of
    reflective techniques."

    Algorithms for computing integral bases of an algebraic function field
    are implemented in some computer algebra systems. They are used e.g.
    for the integration of algebraic functions. The method used by Maple
    5.2 and AXIOM is given by Trager in [Trag84]. He adapted an algorithm
    of Ford and Zassenhaus [Ford, 1978], that computes the ring of
    integers in an algebraic number field, to the case of a function field.

    It turns out that using algebraic geometry one can write a faster
    algorithm. The method we will give is based on Puiseux expansions.
    One cas see this as a variant on the Coates' algorithm as it is
    described in [Davenport, 1981]. Some difficulties in computing with
    Puiseux expansions can be avoided using a sharp bound for the number
    of terms required which will be given in Section 3. In Section 5 we
    derive which denominator is needed in the integral basis. Using this
    result 'intermediate expression swell' can be avoided.

    The Puiseux expansions generally introduce algebraic extensions. These
    extensions will not appear in the resulting integral basis."

    An important feature of modern computer algebra systems is the support
    of a rich type system with the possibility of type inference. Basic
    features of such a type system are polymorphism and coercion between
    types. Recently the use of order-sorted rewrite systems was proposed
    as a general framework. We will give a quite simple example of a
    family of types arising in computer algebra whose coercion relations

    We study type systems for computer algebra systems, which frequently

    syntactically described as terms of a regular order-sorted signature
    if no type parameters are allowed. Using results obtained for the
    functional programming language Haskell we will show that the problem
    of {\sl type inference} is decidable. This result still holds if
    higher-order functions are present and {\sl parametric polymorphism}
    is used. These additional typing constructs are useful for further
    extensions of existing computer algebra systems: These typing concepts

    "Equational theorem proving is interesting both from a mathematical
    and a computational point of view. Many mathematical structures like
    monoids, groups, etc. can be described by equational axioms. So the
    theory of free monoids, free groups, etc. is the equational theory
    defined by these axioms. A decision procedure for the equational
    theory is a solution for the word problem over the associated
    algebraic structure. From a computational point of view, abstract data
    types are basically described by equations. Thus, proving properties
    of an abstract data type amounts to proving theorems in the associated
    equational theory.

    One approach to equational theorem proving consists in associating a
    direction with the equational axioms, thus transforming them into
    rewrite rules. Now in order to prove an equation $a=b$, the rewrite
    rules are applied to both sides, finally yielding reduced versions
    $a^{'}$ and $b^{'}$ of the left and right hand sides, respectively. If
    $a^{'}$ and $b^{'}$ agree syntactically, then the equation holds in
    the equational theory. However, in general this argument cannot be
    reversed; $a^{'}$ and $b^{'}$ might be different even if $a=b$ is a
    theorem. The reason for this problem is that the rewrite system might
    not have the Church-Rosser property. So the goal is to take the
    original rewrite system and transform it into an equivalent one which
    has the desired Church-Rosser property.

    We show how rewrite systems can be used for proving theorems in
    equational and inductive theories, and how an equational specification
    of a problem can be turned into a rewrite program."

    The Hermite reduction is a symbolic integration technique that reduces

    precomputation of an integral basis, which makes the reduction
    impractical for either multiple algebraic extensions or complicated

    The CAD-based quantifier elimination algorithm takes a formula from
    the elementary theory of real closed fields as input, and constructs a
    CAD of the space of the formula's unquantified variables. This
    decomposition is truth invariant with respect to the input formula,
    meaning that the formula is either identically true or identically
    false in each cell of the decomposition. The method determines the
    truth of the input formula for each cell of the CAD, and then uses the
    CAD to construct a solution formula -- a quantifier free formula that
    is equivalent to the input formula. This final phase of the algorithm,
    the solution formula construction phase, is the focus of this thesis.

    An optimal solution formula construction algorithm would be {\sl
    complete} -- i.e. applicable to any truth-invariant CAD, would be {\sl
    efficient}, and would produce {\sl simple} solution formulas. Prior to
    this thesis, no method was available with even two of these three
    properties. Several algorithms are presented, all addressing problems
    related to solution formula construction. In combination, these
    provide an efficient and complete method for constructing solution
    formulas that are simple in a variety of ways.

    Algorithms presented in this thesis have been implemented using the
    SACLIB library, and integrated into QEPCAD, a SACLIB-based
    implementation of quantifier elimination by CAD. Example computations
    based on these implementations are discussed."

    One principle of structured programming is that a program should be
    separated into meaningful independent subprograms, which are then
    combined so that the relation of the parts to the whole can be clearly
    established.  This paper describes several alternative ways to compose
    programs. The main method used is to permit the programmer to denote
    by an expression the sequence of values taken on by a variable. The
    sequence is represented by a function called a stream, which is a
    functional analog of a coroutine. The conventional while and for loops
    of structured programming may be composed by a technique of stream
    processing (analogous to list processing), which results in more
    structured programs than the orignals. This technique makes it
    possible to structure a program in a natural way into its logically
    separate parts, which can then be considered independently."

    The aim of this paper is to present how the dynamic evaluation method
    can be used to deal with the real closure of an ordered field. Two
    kinds of questions, or tests, may be asked in an ordered field:
    equality tests $(a=b?)$ and sign tests $(a > b?)$. Equality tests are
    handled through splittings, exactly as in the algebraic closure of a
    field. Sign tests are handled throug a structure called ``Tarski data

    We define a categorical framework, based on the notion of {\sl

    specifications and algebraic programming. This framework goes far
    beyond our initial motivations, which was to specify computation with
    algebraic numbers. We begin by redefining sketches in order to deal
    explicitly with programs. Expressions and terms are carefully defined
    and studied, then {\sl quasi-projective sketches} are introduced. We
    describe {\sl static evaluation} in these sketches: we propose a
    rigorous basis for evaluation in the corresponding structures. These
    structures admit an initial model, but are not necessarily
    equational. In Part II (Duval and Reynaud 1994), we study a more
    general process, called {\sl dynamic evaluation}, for structures that

    We know we can solve this problem: Given any rational function

    necessary, algebraic numbers. But in many circumstances an approximate

    it would be more useful to solve the problem to allow definite
    integration, or introduce additional parameters so that we can solve
    multiple definite integrations.  How can a computer algebra system
    best answer the more useful questions?  Finally, what if the integrand

Design and Implementation of Symbolic Computation Systems (DISCO 90)
A. Miola, (ed) vol 429 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science
Springer-Verlag, pp56-60
  abstract = "
    Computer algebra systems of the new generation, like Scratchpad, are
    characterized by a very rich type concept, which models the
    relationship between mathematical domains of computation. To use these
    systems interactively, however, the user should be freed of type
    information. A type inference mechanism determines the appropriate
    function to call. All known models which allow to define a semantics
    for type inference cannot express the rich ``mathematical'' type
    structure, so presently type inference is done heuristically.  The
    following paper defines a semantics for a subproblem thereof, namely
    coercion, which is based on rewrite rules. From this definition, and
    efficient coercion algorith for Scratchpad is constructed using graph
    techniques."

  paper = "Gru93.pdf",
  abstract = "
    The automatic computation of limits can be reduced to two main
    sub-problems. The first one is asymptotic comparison where one must
    decide automatically which one of two functions in a specified class
    dominates the other one asymptotically. The second one is asymptotic
    cancellation and is usually exemplified by
    \[e^x[exp(1/x+e^{-x})-exp(1/x)],\quad{}x \leftarrow \infty\]

    In this example, if the sum is expanded in powers of $1/x$, the
    expansion always yields $O(x^{-k})$, and this is not enough to
    conclude.

    In 1990, J.Shackell found an algorithm that solved both these problems
    for the case of $exp-log$ functions, i.e. functions build by recursive
    application of exponential, logarithm, algebraic extension and field
    operations to one variable and the rational numbers. D. Gruntz and
    G. Gonnet propose a slightly different algorithm for exp-log
    functions.  Extensions to larger classes of functions are also
    discussed."

    has no solutions which can be written using elementary functions, or
    anti-derivatives of elementary functions, or exponentials of such
    anti-derivatives, or anti-derivative of those, etc. We should note
    that Equation 1 can be solved using power series, integrals which
    depend on a parameter, or Bessel functions of order $1/3$.  However,
    as we will see, none of these methods of solution are ``algebraic'' in
    nature.

    We aim to give a precise definition of ``algebraic'' by developing the
    theory of {\sl differential algebra}, which is largely the work of
    Ritt. Other contributors are Liouville, Picard, Vessoit, Kolchin,
    Rosenlicht, ... The part of differential Galois theory which leads to
    a proof of Abel's celebrated result that a general polynomial equation
    of degree five or higher cannot be solved by radicals. In effort to
    derive these two areas in parallel, we will also explain why the
    polynomial equation
    \[x^5-4x^2-2=0\]
    has no solutions which can be written as radicals of solutions to
    lower degree polyomial equations."

  abstract = "
    This paper proposes a fast algorithm for computing multiplicative
    inverses in $GF(2^m)$ using normal bases. Normal bases have the
    following useful property: In the case that an element $x$ in
    $GF(2^m)$ is represented by normal bases, $2^k$ power operation of an
    element $x$ in $GF(2^m)$ can be carried out by $k$ times cyclic shift
    of its vector representation.  C.C. Wang et al. proposed an algorithm
    for computing multiplicative inverses using normal bases, which
    requires $(m-2)$ multiplications in $GF(2^m)$ and $(m-1)$ cyclic
    shifts. The fast algorithm proposed in this paper also uses normal
    bases, and computes multiplicative inverses iterating multiplications
    in $GF(2^m)$. It requires at most $2[log_2(m-1)]$ multiplications in
    $GF(2^m)$ and $(m-1)$ cyclic shifts, which are much less than those
    required in Wang's method. The same idea of the proposed fast
    algorithm is applicable to the general power operation in $GF(2^m)$
    and the computation of multiplicative inverses in $GF(q^m)$
    $(q=2^n)$."

    generates very big intermediate data and fails for many problems. We

    triangular sets. A first prt presents two algorithms to compute
    polynomial gcds over tower of simple extensions. The first one was
    designed by Renaud Rioboo and applies to algebraic towers. The second
    one is a generalization of the previous one to the most general case
    of seperable towers. These algorithms lead to an efficient
    implementation of two methods suggested by Daniel Lazard to solve
    polynomial systems by means of triangular sets. These programs solved
    problems that were previously unreachable. The second method was only
    sketched by its author. So, a second part of this thesis presents the
    necessary developements to describe a right implementation. Moreover,
    a theorecal and unified presentation, together with an experimental
    comparison with similar methods due to Wu Wen-Tsun, Dongming Wang and
    Michael Kalkbrener were realized by Philippe Aubry and are reported in
    a third part of this document."

   "R is a programming language that has been gaining popularity in the
    domains such as machine learning and artificial intelligence over the
    recent years. It has been praised for its simplicity and elasticity,
    and its creators were even assigned a rockstar status.

    In my pamphlet, I claim that this ``blazing new technology'' is
    actually a step backwards in the development of the domains that it
    tries to tackle, and the better means of expression, or better tools
    for doing the job, were available at least since the 70s, and recently
    they were only getting better.

    This pamphlet explores and expresses various {\sl computational
    intelligence methods} using {\sl Guile}, a very pleasant
    implementation of the {\sl Scheme} programming language."

  abstract = 
    "Various algebraic models have been used to implement symbolic
    procedures for solving summations and recurrences. Surprisingly, one
    model that has received little attention in the development of
    symbolic algorithms is generating functions. Generating function
    methods for discrete mathematics provide an ad hoc collection of
    techniques for solving summations and recurrences. In this work we
    consider their systematic application to symbolic computation.
     
    To demonstrate the feasibility and capabilities of generating
    functions as an algebraic model of computation, we develop and
    implement algorithms for manipulating generating functions and the
    sequences that they encode. In particular, we concentrate on
    algorithms for solving summations and recurrences. Techniques are
    developed to handle special functions and hybrid terms, which are
    terms involving two or more factors.
     
    Given various classes of summations and recurrences we develop a
    theory to characterize the form of their solution. This allows us to
    demonstrate the ability of our algorithms to solve problems of these
    classes. This knowledge also assists us in developing algorithms that
    know where to look for a solution rather than doing an ad hoc search
    for a solution."

    We describe the development of a repository of mathematical knowledge

    indefinite integration. It is important that the repository be not
    confused with a look-up table. The database of transformation rules is
    at present encoded in Mathematica, but this is only one convenient
    form of the repository, and it could be readily translated into other
    formats. The principles upon which the set of rules is compiled is
    described. One important principle is minimality. The benefits of the
    approach are illustrated with examples, and with the results of
    comparisons with other approaches."

    Bracket coefficients for polynomials are introduced. These are like
    specific precision floating point numbers together with error
    terms. Working in terms of bracket coefficients, an algorithm that
    computes a Gr{\"o}bner basis with floating point coefficients is
    presented, and a new criterion for determining whether a bracket
    coefficient is zero is proposed. Given a finite set $F$ of polynomials
    with real coefficients, let $G_\mu$ be the result of the algorithm for
    $F$ and a precision $\mu$, and $G$ be a true Gr{\"o}bner basis of
    $F$. Then, as $\mu$ approaches infinity, $G_\mu$ converges to $G$
    coefficientwise. Moreover, there is a precision $M$ such that if 
    $\mu \ge M$, then the sets of monomials with non-zero coefficients of
    $G_\mu$ and $G$ are exactly the same. The practical usefulness of the
    algorithm is suggested by experimental results."

    MACSYMA is a system for symbolic manipulation of algebraic expressions
    which is being developed at Project MAC, M.I.T. This paper discusses
    its philosophy, goals, and current achievements.

    Drawing on the past work of Maring, Moses, and Engelman, it extends
    the capabilities of automated algebraic manipulation systems in
    several areas, including

    a) limit calculations
    b) symbolic integration
    c) solution of equations
    d) canonical simplification
    e) user-level pattern matching
    f) user-specified expression manipulation
    g) programming and bookkeeping assistance

    MACSYMA makes extensive use of the power of its rational function
    subsystem. The facilities derived from this are discussed in
    considerable detail.

    An appendix briefly notes some highlights of the overall system."

    We give algorithms for the computation of the $d$-th digit of certain
    transcendental numbers in various bases. These algorithms can be
    easily implemented (multiple precision arithmetic is not needed),
    require virtually no memeory, and feature run times that scale nearly
    linearly with the order of the digit desired. They make it feasible to
    compute, for example, the billionth binary digit of log(2) or $\pi$ on
    a modest work station in a few hours run time.

    We demonstrate this technique by computing the ten billionth
    hexadecimal digit of $\pi$, the billionth hexadecimal digits of
    $\pi^2$, log(2), and log${}^2$(2), and the ten billionth decimal digit
    of log(9/10).

    These calculations rest on the observation that very special types of
    identities exist for certain numbers like $\pi$, $\pi^2$, log(2) and
    log${}^2$. These are essentially polylogarithmic ladders in an integer
    base. A number of these identities that we derive in this work appear
    to be new, for example the critical identity for $\pi$:

    \[\pi=\sum_{i=0}^\infty{\frac{1}{16^i}\left(
    \frac{4}{8i+1}-\frac{2}{8i+4}-\frac{1}{8i+5}-\frac{1}{8i+6}\right)}\]"

    needs of research projects in pure mathematics and applications, and
    supporting the full research life-cycle from exploration, through
    proof and publication, to archival and sharing of data and code.

    OpenDreamKit will be built out of a sustainable ecosystem of
    community-developed open software, databases, and ser- vices,
    including popular tools such as LINBOX, MPIR, SAGE (sagemath.org),
    GAP, PARI/GP, LMFDB, and SINGULAR. We will extend the JUPYTER Notebook
    environment to provide a flexible user interface. By improving and
    unifying existing build- ing blocks, OpenDreamKit will maximise both
    sustainability and impact, with beneficiaries extending to scientific
    computing, physics, chemistry, biology and more, and including
    researchers, teachers, and industrial practitioners.

    We will define a novel component-based VRE architecture and adapt
    existing mathematical software, databases, and user interface
    components to work well within it on varied platforms. Interfaces to
    standard HPC and grid services will be built in. Our architecture will
    be informed by recent research into the sociology of mathematical
    collaboration, so as to properly support actual research practice. The
    ease of set up, adaptability and global impact will be demonstrated in
    a variety of demonstrator VREs.

    We will ourselves study the social challenges associated with
    large-scale open source code development and publications based on
    executable documents, to ensure sustainability.

    OpenDreamKit will be conducted by a Europe-wide steered by demand
    collaboration, including leading mathematicians, computational
    researchers, and software developers with a long track record of
    delivering innovative open source software solutions for their
    respective communities. All produced code and tools will be open
