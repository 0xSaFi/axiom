\chapter{The Axiom Bibliography}
This bibliography serves two purposes. It generates output for the
ACM bibliography (beebe.bib) and Axiom (axiom.bib).

This bibliography covers areas of computational mathematics.
Papers which mention Axiom have a ``keyword='' entry of ``axiomref''.
Papers we have on site have a ``paper='' entry. Papers which are
referenced in the algebra have the ``algebra'' tag.

The authors are listed in the index. The topic keywords are listed in the
index. Algorithms are mentioned in the index. 

The {\bf TO} index entry tries to say that the first
named algorithm or author has been updated or improved by the second
named algorithm or author.

Introduction of special terms (e.g. Toeplitz matrix) may include a
paragraph for those unfamiliar with the terms.

   "In this paper we will explore the nonassociative algebraic structure

    initiated with the theories of Charles Darwin, it was the Augustinian
    monk Gregor Mendel who began to uncover the mathematical nature of the
    subject. In fact, the symbolism Mendel used to describe his first
    results (e.g. see his 1866 paper {\sl Experiments in
    Plant-Hybridization} is quite algebraically suggestive. Seventy four
    years later, I.M.H. Etherington introduced the formal language of
    abstract algebra to the study of genetics in his series of seminal
    papers. In this paper we will discuss the concepts of genetics that
    suggest the underlying algebraic structure of inheritance, and we will
    give a brief overview of the algebras which arise in genetics and some
    of their basi properties and relationships. With the popularity of
    biologically motivated mathematics continuing to rise, we offer this
    survey article as another example of the breadth of mathematics that
    has biological significance. The most comprehensive reference for the
    mathematical research done in this area (through 1980) is

    Sparse and structured matrices over finite fields occur in many
    settings.  Sparse linear systems arise in sieve-based integer factoring
    and discrete logarithm algorithms. Structured matrices arise in
    polynomial factoring algorithms; one example is the famous Q-matrix
    from Berlekamp's method.  Sparse diophantine linear problems, like
    computing the Smith canonical form of an integer matrix or computing
    an integer solution to a sparse linear system, are reduced via p-adic
    lifting to sparse matrix analysis over a finite field.

    In the past 10 years there has been substantial activity on the
    improvement of a solution proposed by Wiedemann in 1986. The main new

    The main idea of the ``black box'' approach in exact linear algebra is
    to reduce matrix problems to the computation of minimum polynomials.
    In most cases preconditioning is necessary to obtain the desired
    result.  Here good preconditioners will be used to ensure geometrical
    / algebraic properties on matrices, rather than numerical ones, so we
    do not address a condition number. We offer a review of problems for
    which (algebraic) preconditioning is used, provide a bestiary of
    preconditioning problems, and discuss several preconditioner types to
    solve these problems.  We present new conditioners, including
    conditioners to preserve low displacement rank for Toeplitz-like
    matrices. We also provide new analyses of preconditioner performance
    and results on the relations among preconditioning problems and with
    linear algebra problems.  Thus, improvements are offered for the
    efficiency and applicability of preconditioners. The focus is on
    linear algebra problems over finite fields, but most results are valid

    The computation of the determinant of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ of
    numbers or polynomials is a challenge for both numerical and symbolic
    methods. Numerical methods, such as Clarkson's algorithm [10,7] for
    the sign of the determinant must deal with conditionedness that
    determines the number of mantissa bits necessary for obtaining a
    correct sign. Symbolic algorithms that are based on Chinese
    remaindering [6,17,Chapter 5.5] must deal with the fact that the
    length of the determinant in the worse case grows linearly in the
    dimension of the matrix. Hence the number of modular operations is $n$
    times the number of arithmetic operations in a given algorithm.
    Hensel lifting combined with rational number recovery [14,1] has cubic
    bit complexity in $n$, but the algorithm can only determine a factor
    of the determinant, namely the largest invariant factor. If the matrix
    is similar to a multiple of the identity matrix, the running time is
    again that of Chinese remaindering.",

\index{explain!Sylvester matrix}
The Sylvester matrix is used to compute the {\bf resultant} of two
polynomials. The Sylvester matrix is formed from the coefficients of
the two polynomials. Given a polynomial with degree $m$ and another of
degree $n$ form an $(m+n)\times(m+n)$ matrix by filling the matrix
from the upper left corner with the coefficients of the first
polynomial then shifting down one row and one column to the right and
filling in the coefficients starting there until they hit the right
column.  Starting at the next row, do the same process for the second
polynomial.  The determinant of this matrix is the {\bf resultant} of
the two polynomials.

For example, given $a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0$ and $b_2x^2+b_1x+b_0$
the Sylvester matrix is a $(3+2)\times(3+2)$ matrix:
\[\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0 & 0\\
0 & a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0\\
b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0
\end{array}\right]\]

\index{explain!resultant}
The resultant of these two polynomials (assuming a leading coefficient
of 1), is the product of the differences $p_i-q_i$ between the roots
of the polynomials. If there are roots in common then the product
will contain a 0 and the whole equation reduces to 0. This can be
used to determine if two polynomials have common roots.

For example, given a polynomial in $x$ with distinct roots $a_1$ 
and $a_2$ it can be factored as $t1:=(x-a_1)(x-a_2)$. 

Given a second polynomial in $x$ with distinct roots $b_1$, $b_2$, 
and $b_3$ it can be factored as $t2:=(x-b_1)(x-b_2)(x-b_3)$.

The Axiom call of $resultant(t1,t2,x)$ is
\[ (b_1-a_2)(b_1-a_1)(b_2-a_2)(b_2-a_1)(b_3-a_2)(b_3-a_1) \]

In symbolic form the resultant can show the multiplicity of roots
when shown in factored form.

    The Toeplitz-likeness of a matrix (Kailath et al. 1979) is the
    generalization of the notion that a matrix is Toeplitz. Block matrices
    with Toeplitz blocks, such as the Sylvester matrix corresponding to
    the resultant of two univariate polynomials, are Toeplitz-like, as are
    products and inverses of Toeplitz-like matrices. The displacement rank
    of a matrix is a measure for the degree of being Toeplitz-like. For
    example, an $r\times s$ block matrix with Toeplitz blocks has
    displacement rank $r+s$ whereas a generic $N\ximtes N$ matrix has
    displacement rank $N$.  A matrix of displacement rank $\alpha$ can be

    polynomials with coefficients in an arbitrary field. The algorithm has
    two important advantages over our previous one: the multipliers

    algorithm. Our algorithm reduces the problem of Smith form
    computations to two Hermite form computations.  Thus the Smith form
    problem has complexity asymptotically that of the Hermite form
    problem. We also construct fast parallel algorithms for Jordan normal
    form and testing similarity of matrices. Both the similarity and
    non-similarity problems are in the complexity class RNC for the usual
    coefficient fields, i.e., they can be probabilistically decided in
    poly-logarithmic time using polynomially many processors.",

    Douglas Wiedemann's (1986) landmark approach to solving sparse linear
    systems over finite fields provides the symbolic counterpart to
    non-combinatorial numerical methods for solving sparse linear systems,
    such as the Lanczos or conjugate gradient method (see Golub and van
    Loan (1983)). The problem is to solve a sparse linear system, when the
    individual entries lie in a generic field, and the only operations
    possible are field arithmethic; the solution is to be exact. Such is
    the situation, for instance, if one works in a finite field. Wiedemann
    bases his approach on Krylov subspaces, but projects further to a
    sequence of individual field elements. By making a link to the
    Berlekamp / Massey problem from coding theory -- the coordinate
    recurrences -- and by using randomization an algorithm is obtained
    with the following property. On input of an $n\times n$ coefficient
    matrix $A$ given by a so-called black box, which is a program that can
    multiply the matrix by a vector (see Figure 1), and of a vector $b$,
    the algorithm finds, with high probability in case the system is
    solvable, a random solution vector $x$ with $Ax=b$. It is assumed that
    the field has sufficiently many elements, say no less than $50n^2
    log(x)$, otherwise one goes to a finite algebraic extension. The
    complexity of the method is in the general singular case $O(n log
    (n))$ calls to the black box for $A$ and an additional $O(n^2
    log(n)^2)$ field arithmetic operations.",

    The problem of solving a large sparse or structured system of linear
    equations in the symbolic context, for instance when the coefficients
    lie in a finite field, has arisen in several applications. A famous
    example are the linear systems of ${\bf F}_2$, the field with 2
    elements, that arise in sieve based integer factoring algorithms. For
    example, for the factorization of the RSA-130 challenge number several
    column dependencies of a $3504823\times 3516502$ matrix with an
    average of $39.4.$ non-zero entries per column needed to be computed
    [10]. A second example is the Berlekamp polynomial factorization
    algorithm [6]. In that example, the matrix is not explicitly
    constructed, but instead a fast algorithm for performing the matrix
    times vector product is used. Further examples for such ``black box

    Gr{\"o}bner bases, the Risch integration algorithm, integer lattice 
    basis reduction, hypergeometric summation algorithms, etc. From the
    beginning in the early 60s, it has been the tradition of our discipline
    to create software that makes our ideas readily available to a 
    scientists, engineers, and education: {SAC-1}, {Reduce}, {Macsyma}, etc.
    The commercial viability of our system products is proven by Maple and

    We give a stability criterion for real polynomial inequalities with
    floating point or inexact scalars by estimating from below or
    computing the radius of semdefiniteness. That radious is the maximum
    deformation of the polynomial coefficent vector measured in a weighted
    Euclidean vector norm within which the inequality remains true. A
    large radius means that the inequalities may be considered numerically
    valid.

    The radius of positive (or negative) semidefiniteness is the distance
    to the nearest polynomial with a real root, which has been thoroughly
    studied before. We solve this problem by parameterized Lagrangian
    multipliers and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Our algorithms can
    compute the radius for several simultaneous inequalities including
    possibly additional linear coefficient constraints. Our distance
    measure is the weighted Euclidena coefficient norm, but we also
    discuss several formulas for the weighted infinity and 1-norms.

    The computation of the nearest polynomial with a real root can be
    interpreted as a dual of Seidenberg's method that decides if a real
    hypersurface contains a real point. Sums-of-squares rational lower
    bound certificates for the radius of semidefinitesness provide a new
    approach to solving Seidenberg's problem, especially when the
    coeffcients are numeric. They also offer a surprising alternative
    sum-of-squares proof for those polynomials that themselves cannot be
    represented by a polynomial sum-of-squares but that have a positive
    distance to the nearest indefinte polynomial.",

    Several standard problems in symbolic computation, such as greatest
    common divisors and factorization of polynomials, sparse
    interpolation, or computing solutions to overdetermined systems of
    polynomial equations have non-trivial solutions only if the input
    coefficients satisfy certain algebraic constraints. Errors in the
    coefficients due to floating point round-off or through physical
    measurement thus render the exact symbolic algorithms unusable. By
    symbolic-numeric methods one computes minimal deformations of the
    coefficients that yield non-trivial results. We will present hybrid
    algorithms and benchmark computations based on Gauss-Newton
    optimazation, singular value decomposition (SVD) and
    structure-preserving total least squares (STLS) fitting for several of
    the above problems.

    A significant body of results to solve those ``approximate computer
    algebra'' problems has been discovered in the past 10 years. In the
    Computer Algebra Handbook the section on ``Hybrid Methods'' concludes
    as follows [2]: ``The challenge of hybrid symbolic-numeric algorithms
    is to explore the effects of imprecision, discontinuity, and
    algorithmic complexity by applying mathematical optimization,
    perturbation theory, and inexact arithmetic and other tools in order
    to solve mathematical problems that today are not solvable by
    numeriiical or symbolic methods alone.'' The focus of our tutorial is
    on how to formulate several approximate symbolic computation problems
    as numerical problems in linear algebra and optimization and on
    software that realizes their solutions.",

    The numeric SOSes produced by the current fixed precision

    via Maple 11's exact linear algebra. Therefore, before projection we
    refine the SOSes by rank-preserving Newton iteration. For smaller
    problems the starting SOSes for Newton can be guessed without SDP
    (``SDP-free SOS''), but for larger inputs we additionally appeal to

    functions. For instance: a black box polynomial is a procedure that
    takes values for the variables as input and evaluates the polynomial
    at that given point. FOXBOX can compute the greatest common divisor
    and factorize polynomials in black box representation, producing as
    output new black boxes. It also can compute the standard sparse
    distributed representation of a black box polynomial, for example, one
    which was computed for an irreducible factor. We establish that the
    black box representation of objects can push the size of symbolic
    expressions far beyond what standard data structures could handle
    before.

    Furthermore, FOXBOX demonstrates the generic program design
    methodology. The FOXBOX system is written in C++. C++ template
    arguments provide for abstract domain types. Currently, FOXBOX can be
    compiled with SACLIB 1.1, Gnu-MP 1.0, and NTL 2.0 as its underlying
    field and polynomial arithmetic. Multiple arithmetic plugins can be

    "We define reproducibility to mean getting bitwise identical results
    from multiple runs of the same program, perhaps with different
    hardware resources or other changes that should ideally not change the
    answer. Many users depend on reproducibility for debugging or
    correctness. However, dynamic scheduling of parallel computing
    resources, combined with nonassociativity of floating point addition,
    makes attaining reproducibility a challenge even for simple operations
    like summing a vector of numbers, or more complicated operations like
    Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS). We describe an algorithm that
    computes a reproducible sum of floating point numbers independent of
    the order of summation. The algorithm depends only on a subset of the
    IEEE Floating Point Standard 754-2008. It is communication-optimal, in
    the sense that it does just one pass over the data in the sequential
    case, or one reduction operation in the parallel case, requiring an
    ``accumulator'' represented by just 6 floating point words (more can
    be used if higher precision is desired). Th arithmetic code with a
    6-word accumulator is $7n$ floating point additions to sum $n$ words,
    and (in IEEEE double precision) the final error bound can be up to
    $10^8$ times smaller than the error bound for conventional
    summation. We describe the basic summation algorithm, the software
    infrastructure used to build reproducible BLAS (ReproBLAS), and
    performance results. For example, when computing the dot product of
    4096 double precision floating point numbers, we get a $4x$ slowdown
    compared to Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) running on an Intel Core
    i7-2600 CPU operating at 3.4 GHz and 256 KB L2 Cache.",

  abstract = 
    "A suite of {\sl self-scaling} fast circular plane rotation algorithms
    is developed which obviates the monitoring and periodic rescaling
    necessitated by the standard set of fast plane rotation
    algorithms. Self-Scaling fast rotations dynamically preserve the
    normed scaling of the diagonal factor matrix whereas standard fast
    rotations exhibit divergent scaling. Variations on standard fast
    rotation matrices are developed and algorithms which implement them
    are offered. Self-Scaling fast rotations are shown to be essentially
    as accurate as slow rotations and at least as efficient as standard
    fast rotations. Computational experimental results utilizing the
    Cray-2 illustrate the effectively stable scaling exhibited by
    self-scaling fast rotations. Jacobi-class algorithms with one-sided
    alterations are developed for the algebraic eigenvalue decomposition
    using self-scaling fast plane rotations and one-sided
    modifications. The new algorithms are shown to be both accurate and
    efficient on both vector and parallel architectures. The utility is
    described of applying fast plane rotations towards the rank-one update
    and downdate of least squares factorizations. The equivalence is
    illuminated of LINPACK, hyperbolic rotation, and fast negatively
    weighted plane rotation downdating. Algorithms are presented which
    apply self-scaling fast plane rotations to the QR factorization for
    stiff least squares problems. Both fast and standard Givens
    rotation-based algorithms are shown to produce accurate results
    regardless of row sorting even with extremely heavily row weighted
    matrices. Such matrices emanate, e.g. from equality constrainted least
    squares problems solved via the weighting method. The necessity of
    column sorting is emphasized. Numerical tests expose the Householder
    QR factorization algorithm to be sensitive to row sorting and it
    yields less accurate results for greater weights. Additionally, the
    modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm is shown to be sensitive to row
    sorting to a notably significant but lesser degree. Self-Scaling fast
    plane rotation algorithms, having competitive computational
    complexities, must therefore be the method of choice for the QR
    factorization of stiff matrices. Timing reults on the Cray 2 [XY]M/P,
    and C90, of rotations both in and out of a matrix factorization
    context are presented. Architectural features that can best exploit
    the advantagous features of the new fast rotations are subsequently

    "We present the design and testing of an algorithm for iterative
    refinement of the solution of linear equations, were the residual is
    computed with extra precision. This algorithm was originally proposed
    in the 1960s as a means to compute very accurate solutions to all but
    the most ill-conditioned linear systems of equations. However two
    obstacles hae until now prevented its adoption in standard subroutine
    libraries like LAPACK: (1) There was no standard way to access the
    higher precision arithmetic needed to compute residuals, and (2) it
    was unclear how to compute a reliable error bound for the computed
    solution. The completion of the new BLAS Technical Forum Standard has
    recently removed the first obstacle. To overcome the second obstacle,
    we show how a single application of iterative refindment can be used
    to copute an error bound in any norm at small cost, and use this to
    compute both an error bound in the usual infinity norm, and a
    componentwise relative error bound.

    We report extensive test results on over 6.2 million matrices of
    dimension 5, 10, 100, and 1000. As long as a normwise
    (resp. componentwise) condition number computed by the algorithm is
    less than $1/max(10,\sqrt{n})\epsilon_w$, the computed normwise
    (resp. componentwise) error bound is at most
    $2max(10,\sqrt{n})\epsilon_w$, and indeed bounds the true error. Here,

    "Computing the eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors of an $n\times n$
    symmetric tridiagonal matrix is an important task that arises while
    solving any symmetric eigenproblem. All practical software requires
    $O(n^3)$ time to compute all the eigenvectors and ensure their
    orthogonality when eigenvalues are close. In the first part of this
    thesis we review earlier work and show how some existing
    implementations of inverse iteration can fail in surprising ways.
    
    The main contribution of this thesis is a new $O(n^2)$, easily
    parallelizable algorithm for solving the tridiagonal
    eigenproblem. Three main advances lead to our new algorithm. A
    tridiagonal matrix is traditionally represented by its diagonal and
    off-diagonal elements. Our most important advance is in recognizing
    that its bidiagonal factors are ``better'' for computational
    purposes. The use of bidiagonals enables us to invoke a relative
    criterion to judge when eigenvalues are ``close''. The second advance
    comes with using multiple bidiagonal factorizations in order to
    compute different eigenvectors independently of each other. Thirdly,
    we use carefully chosen dqds-like transformations as inner loops to
    compute eigenpairs that are highly accurate and ``faithful'' to the
    various bidiagonal representations. Orthogonality of the eigenvectors
    is a consequence of this accuracy. Only $O(n)$ work per eigenpair is
    neede by our new algorithm.
    
    Conventional wisdom is that there is usually a trade-off between speed
    and accuracy in numerical procedures, i.e., higher accuracy can be
    achieved only at the expense of greater computing time. An interesting
    aspect of our work is that increased accuracy in the eigenvalues and
    eigenvectors obviates the need for explicit orthogonalization and
    leads to greater speed.
    
    We present timing and accuracy results comparing a computer
    implementation of our new algorithm with four existing EISPACK and
    LAPACK software routines. Our test-bed contains a variety of
    tridiagonal matrices, some coming from quantum chemistry
    applications. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of
    our new algorithm. For example, on a matrix of order 966 that occurs in
    the modeling of a biphenyl molecule our method is about 10 times
    faster than LAPACK's inverse iteration on a serial IBM RS/6000
    processor and nearly 100 times faster on a 128 processor IBM SP2
    parallel machine.",

    results in programs that implicitly used certain identities to
    simplify expressions. These identities, which very likely seemed
    universally true to the programmers in the heat of writing the CAS
    (and often were true in well-known abstract algebraic domains) later
    neede re-examination when such systems were extended for dealing with
    kinds of objects unanticipated in the original design. These new
    objects are generally introduced to the CAS by extending
    ``generically'' the arithmetic of other operations. For example,
    approximate floats do not have the mathematical properties of exact
    integers or rationals. Complex numbers may strain a system designed
    for real-valued variables. In the situation examined here, we consider
    two categories of ``extended'' numbers: $\infty$ and {\sl undefined},

    troublesome notions, how their introduction into a computer algebra
    system may require a (sometimes painful) reconsideration and redesign
    of parts of the program, and how they are related. An alternative
    (followed most notably by the Axiom system is to essentially envision
    a ``meta'' CAS defined in terms of categories and inheritance with
    only the most fundamental built-in concepts; from these one can build
    many variants of specific CAS features. This approach is appealing but

    "Bisection is one of the most common methods used to compute the
    eigenvalues of symmetric tridiagonal matrices. Bisection relies on the
    {\sl Sturm count}: for a given shift $\sigma$, the number of negative
    pivots in the factorization $T-\sigma{}I=LDL^T$ equals the number of
    eigenvalues of $T$ that are smaller than $\sigma$. In IEEE-754
    arithmetic, the value $\infty$ permits the computation to continue
    past a zero pivot, producing a correct Sturm count when $T$ is
    unreduced. Demmel and Li showed in the 90s that using $\infty$ rather
    than testing for zero pivots within the loop could improve performance
    significantly on certain architectures.
    
    When eigenvalues are to be computed to high relative accuracy, it is
    often preferable to work with $LDL^T$ factorizations instead of the
    original tridiagonal $T$, see for example the MRRR algorithm. In these
    cases, the Sturm count has to be computed from $LDL^T$. The
    differential stationary and progressive qds algorithms are the method
    of choice.
    
    While it seems trivial to replace $T$ by $LDL^T$, in reality these
    algorithms are more complicated: in IEEE-754 arithmetic, a zero pivot
    produces an overflow, followed by an invalid exception (NaN), that
    renders the Sturm count incorrect.
    
    We present alternative, safe formulations that are guaranteed to
    produce the correct result.
    
    Benchmarking these algorithms on a variety of platforms shows that the
    original formulation without tests is always faster provided no
    exception occurs. The transforms see speed-ups of up to 2.6x over the
    careful formulation.
    
    Tests on industrial matrices show that encountering exceptions in
    practice is rare. This leads to the following design: First, compute
    the Sturm count by the fast but unsafe algorithm. Then, if an
    exception occured, recompute the count by a safe, slower alternative.
    
    The new Sturm count algorithms improve the speed of bisection by up to
    2x on our test matrices. Furthermore, unlike the traditional

    A four-parameter fit is developed for the class of integrals known as
    the exponential integral (real branch). Unlike other fits that are

    valid over the complete domain of the function (compact) and is
    everywhere accurate to within $\pm 0.0052\%$ when evaluating the first
    exponential integral, $E_1$. To achieve this result, a methodology
    that makes use of analytically known limiting behaviors at either
    extreme of the domain is employed. Because the fit accurately captures
    limiting behaviors of the $E_1$ function, more accuracy is retained
    when the fit is used as part of the scheme to evaluate higher-order
    exponential integrals, $E_n$, as compared with the use of brute-force
    fits to $E_1$, which fail to accurately model limiting
    behaviors. Furthermore, because the fit is compact, no special
    accommodations are required (as in the case of spliced piecewise fits)
    to smooth the value, slope, and higher derivatives in the transition
    region between two piecewise domains. The general methodology employed
    to develop this fit is outlined, since it may be used for other

  abstract = "
    This thesis is concerned with calculating polynomial greatest common
    divisors using straight line program representation.

    In the Introduction chapter, we introduce the problem and describe
    some of the traditional representations for polynomials, we then talk
    about some of the general subjects central to the thesis, terminating
    with a synopsis of the category theory which is central to the Axiom
    computer algebra system used during this research.

    The second chapter is devoted to describing category theory. We follow
    with a chapter detailing the important sections of computer code
    written in order to investigate the straight line program subject.
    The following chapter on evalution strategies and algorithms which are
    dependant on these follows, the major algorith which is dependant on
    evaluation and which is central to our theis being that of equality
    checking. This is indeed central to many mathematical problems.
    Interpolation, that is the determination of coefficients of a
    polynomial is the subject of the next chapter. This is very important
    for many straight line program algorithms, as their non-canonical
    structure implies that it is relatively difficult to determine
    coefficients, these being the basic objects that many algorithms work
    on. We talk about three separate interpolation techniques and compare
    their advantages and disadvantages. The final two chapters describe
    some of the results we have obtained from this research and finally
    conclusions we have drawn as to the viability of the straight line
    program approach and possible extensions.

    Finally we terminate with a number of appendices discussing side
    subjects encountered during the thesis.",

    In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum

    ``cobordism'': a manifold representing spacetime, going between two
    manifolds representing space.  But this was just the beginning: simiar
    diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent
    proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise
    of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became
    clear that there is an extensive network of analogies between physics,

    The algebraic hierarchy that is described here is both abstract and
    structured. Structures like groups and rings are port of it in an
    abstract way, defining e.g. a ring as a tuple consisting of a group, a
    binary operation and a constant that together satisfy the properties
    of a ring. In this way, a ring automatically inherits the group
    properties of the additive subgroup. The algebraic hierarchy is
    formalized in Coq by applying a combination of labeled record types
    and coercions. In the labeled record types of Coq, one can use 
    {\sl dependent types}: the type of one label may depend on another
    label. This allows to give a type to a dependent-typed tuple like
    $\langle A, f, a \rangle$, where $A$ is a set, $f$ an operation on $A$
    and $a$ an element of $A$. Coercions are functions that are used

    This thesis describes substantial enhancements that were made to the
    software tools in the Nuprl system that are used to interactively
    guide the production of formal proofs. Over 20,000 lines of code were
    written for these tools. Also, a corpus of formal mathematics was
    created that consists of roughly 500 definitions and 1300
    theorems. Much of this material is of a foundational nature and
    supports all current work in Nuprl. This thesis concentrates on
    describing the half of this corpus that is concerned with abstract
    algebra and that covers topics central to the mathematics of the
    computations carried out by computer algebra systems.
    
    The new proof tools include those that solve linear arithmetic
    problems, those that apply the properties of order relations, those
    that carry out inductive proof to support recursive definitions, and
    those that do sophisticated rewriting. The rewrite tools allow
    rewriting with relations of differing strengths and take care of
    selecting and applying appropriate congruence lemmas automatically.
    The rewrite relations can be order relations as well as equivalence
    relations. If they are order relations, appropriate monotonicity
    lemmas are selected.
    
    These proof tools were heavily used throughout the work on
    computational algebra. Many examples are given that illustrate their
    operation and demonstrate their effectiveness.
    
    The foundation for algebra introduced classes of monoids, groups, ring
    and modules, and included theories of order relations and
    permutations.  Work on finite sets and multisets illustrates how a
    quotienting operation hides details of datatypes when reasoning about
    functional programs. Theories of summation operators were developed
    that drew indices from integer ranges, lists and multisets, and that
    summed over all the classes mentioned above. Elementary factorization
    theory was developed that characterized when cancellation monoids are
    factorial. An abstract data type for the operations of multivariate
    polynomial arithmetic was defined and the correctness of an
    implementation of these operations was verified. The implementation is
    similar to those found in current computer algebra systems.
    
    This work was all done in Nuprl's constructive type theory. The thesis
    discusses the appropriateness of this foundation, and the extent to
    which the work relied on it.",

    avoiding the switch in semantic perspective as is present in widely
    applied methods which include an imperative implementation as an
    intermediate step.

    The first step in the method presented in this paper is to transform a
    mathematical specification into a Haskell program. The next step is to
    make repetition structures explicit by higher order functions, and
    after that rewrite the specification in the form of a Mealy
    Machine. Finally, adaptations have to be made in order to comply to
    the fixed nature of hardware. The result is then given to
    C$\lambda$aSH, a compiler which generates synthesizable VHDL from the
    resulting Haskell code. An advantage of the approach presented here is
    that in all phases of the process the design can be directly simulated
    by executing the defining code in a standard Haskell environment.

    To illustrate the design process, the N queens problem is chosen as a
    running example."

    "We present a new approach to automated reasoning about higher-order

    symbolic values.

    To validate our approach, we use it to develop and evaluate a system
    for verifying and refuting behavioral software contracts of components
    in a functional language, which we call {\sl soft contract
    verification}. In doing so, we discover a mutually beneficial relation
    between behavioral contracts and higher-order symbolic
    execution. Contracts aid symbolic execution by providing a rich
    language of specifications that can serve as the basis of symbolic
    higher-order values; the theory of blame enables modular verification
    and leads to the theorem that {\sl verified compnents can't be
    blamed}; and the run-time monitoring of contracts enables {\sl soft}
    verification whereby verified and unverified components can safely
    interact and verification is not an all-or-nothing
    proposition. Conversely, symbolic execution aids contracts by
    providing compile-time verification which increases assurance and
    enables optimizations; automated test-case generation for contracts
    with counter-examples; and engendering a virtuous cycle between
    verification and the gradual spread of contracts.

    Our system uses higher-order symbolic execution, leveraging contracts
    as a source of symbolic values including unknown behavioral values,
    and employs an updatable heap of contract invariants to reason about
    flow-sensitive facts. Whenever a contract is refuted, it reports a
    concrete {\sl counterexample} reproducing the error, which may involve
    solving for an unknown function. The approach is able to analyze
    first-class contracts, recursive data structures, unknown functions,
    and control-flow-sensitive refinement of values, which are all
    idiomatic in dynamic languages. It makes effective use of an
    off-the-shelf solver to decide problems without heavy encodings. Our
    counterexample search is sound and relatively complete with respect to
    a first-order solver for base type values. Therefore, it can form the
    basis of automated verification and bug-finding tools for higher-order
    programs. The approach is competitive with a wide range of existing
    tools -- including type systems, flow analyzers, and model checkers --
    on their own benchmarks. We have built a tool which analyzes programs
    written in Racket, and report on its effectiveness in verifying and
    refuting contracts.",

    algorithms in the field of computer algebra. We propose the Mizar
    system as a theorem prover capable of verifying generic algorithms on
    an appropriate abstract level. The main advantage of the MIZAR theorem
    prover is its special input language that enables textbook style
    presentation of proofs. For generic versions of Brown/Henrici addition

    a generic algebraic algorithm is correctly instantiated with a
    particular domain. Answering this question that especially arises if
    one wants to implement generic programming languages, in the field of
    computer algebra requires nontrivial mathematical knowledge.

    In considering the reliability of numerical programs, it is normal to
    ``limit our study to the semantics dealing with numerical precision''.
    On the other hand, there is a great deal of work on the reliability of
    programs that essentially ignores the numerics. The thesis of this
    paper is that there is a class of problems that fall between these
    two, which could be described as ``does the low-level arithmetic
    implement the high-level mathematics''. Many of these problems arise
    because mathematics, particularly the mathematics of the complex
    numbers, is more difficult than expected: for example the complex
    function log is not continuous, writing down a program to compute an
    inverse function is more complicated than just solving an equation,
    and many algebraic simplification rules are not universally valid.

    The good news is that these problems are {\sl theoretically} capable
    of being solved, and are {\sl practically} close to being solved, but
    not yet solved, in several real-world examples. However, there is
    still a long way to go before implementations match the theoretical
    possibilities.",

  title = "Guarded Expressions in Practice",

  abstract = "
    Computer algebra systems typically drop some degenerate cases when
    evaluating expressions, e.g. $x/x$ becomes 1 dropping the case
    $x=0$. We claim that it is feasible in practice to compute also the
    degenerate cases yielding {\sl guarded expressions}. We work over real
    closed fields but our ideas about handling guarded expressions can be
    easily transferred to other situations. Using formulas as guards
    provides a powerful tool for heuristically reducing the combinatorial
    explosion of cases: equivalent, redundant, tautological, and
    contradictive cases can be detected by simplification and quantifier
    elimination. Our approach allows to simplify the expressions on the
    basis of simplification knowledge on the logical side. The method
    described in this paper is implemented in the REDUCE package GUARDIAN,
    which is freely available on the WWW.",

    translated and certified without user intervention, even for code with
    loops, thanks to the use of the def::ung macro which allows us to
    defer the question of termination. Initial measurements of concrete
    execution for translated LLVM functions indicate that performance is
    nearly 2.4 million LLVM instructions per second on a typical laptop
    computer. In this paper we overview the translation process and

    In order to find subtle bugs in a system design, it is necessary to
    have a precise description of that design. There are at least two
    major benefits to writing a precise design; the author is forced to
    think more clearly, which helps eliminate ``plausible hand-waving'',
    and tools can be applied to check for errors in the design, even while
    it is being written. In contrast, conventional design documents
    consist of prose, static diagrams, and perhaps pseudo-code in an ad
    hoc untestable language. Such descriptions are far from precise; they
    are often ambiguous, or omit critical aspects such as partial failure
    or the granularity of concurrency (i.e. which constructs are assumed
    to be atomic). At the other end of the spectrum, the final executable
    code is unambiguous, but contains an overwhelming amount of detail. We
    needed to be able to capture the essence of a design in a few hundred
    lines of precise description. As our designs are unavoidably complex,
    we need a highly-expressive language, far above the level of code, but
    with precise semantics. That expressivity must cover real-world
    concurrency and fault-tolerance. And, as we wish to build services
    quickly, we wanted a language that is simple to learn and apply,
    avoiding esoteric concepts. We also very much wanted an existing
    ecosystem of tools.  We found what we were looking for in TLA+, a

    "Mathematical texts can be computerised in many ways that capture
    differing amounts of the mathematical meaning. At one end, there is
    document imaging, which captures the arrangement of black marks on
    paper, while at the other end there are proof assistants (e.g. Mizar,
    Isabelle, Coq, etc.), which capture the full mathematical meaning and
    have proofs expressed in a formal foundation of mathematics. In
    between, there are computer typesetting systems (e.g. Latex and
    Presentation MathML) and semantically oriented systems (e.g. Content
    MathML, OpenMath, OMDoc, etc.). In this paper we advocate a style of
    computerisation of mathematical texts which is flexible enough to
    connect the diferent approaches to computerisation, which allows
    various degrees of formalsation, and which is compatible with
    different logical frameworks (e.g. set theory, category theory, type
    theory, etc.) and proof systems. The basic idea is to allow a
    man-machine collaboration which weaves human input with machine
    computation at every step in the way. We propose that the huge step from
    informal mathematics to fully formalised mathematics be divided into
    smaller steps, each of which is a fully developed method in which
    human input is minimal."

    We present a model for the representation of mathematical objects in

    with applications such as computer algebra systems and proof checkers.
    Using a representation that reflects only the intrinsic information of
    an object, and storing application-dependent information in so-called
    {\sl application descriptions}, it is shown how the translation from
    the internal to an external representation and {\sl vice versa} can be
    achieved. Hereby a formalisation of the concept of {\sl context} is
    introduced. The proposed scheme allows for a high degree of
    application integration, e.g., parallel evaluation of subexpressions

  abstract = "
    The general goal of this thesis is to investigate and develop computer
    algebra tools for the simplification resp. evaluation of definite
    integrals. One way of finding the value of a def- inite integral is
    via the evaluation of an antiderivative of the integrand. In the
    nineteenth century Joseph Liouville was among the first who analyzed
    the structure of elementary antiderivatives of elementary functions
    systematically. In the early twentieth century the algebraic structure
    of differential fields was introduced for modeling the differential
    properties of functions. Using this framework Robert H. Risch
    published a complete algorithm for transcendental elementary
    integrands in 1969. Since then this result has been extended to
    certain other classes of integrands as well by Michael F. Singer,
    Manuel Bronstein, and several others. On the other hand, if no
    antiderivative of suitable form is available, then linear relations
    that are satisfied by the parameter integral of interest may be found
    based on the principle of parametric integration (often called
    differentiating under the integral sign or creative telescoping).

    The main result of this thesis extends the results mentioned above to
    a complete algo- rithm for parametric elementary integration for a
    certain class of integrands covering a majority of the special
    functions appearing in practice such as orthogonal polynomials,
    polylogarithms, Bessel functions, etc. A general framework is provided
    to model those functions in terms of suitable differential fields. If
    the integrand is Liouvillian, then the present algorithm considerably
    improves the efficiency of the corresponding algorithm given by Singer
    et al. in 1985. Additionally, a generalization of Czichowski’s
    algorithm for computing the logarithmic part of the integral is
    presented. Moreover, also partial generalizations to include other
    types of integrands are treated.

    As subproblems of the integration algorithm one also has to find
    solutions of linear or- dinary differential equations of a certain
    type. Some contributions are also made to solve those problems in our
    setting, where the results directly dealing with systems of
    differential equations have been joint work with Moulay A. Barkatou.

    For the case of Liouvillian integrands we implemented the algorithm in
    form of our Mathematica package Integrator. Parts of the
    implementation also deal with more general functions. Our procedures
    can be applied to a significant amount of the entries in integral
    tables, both indefinite and definite integrals. In addition, our
    procedures have been successfully applied to interesting examples of
    integrals that do not appear in these tables or for which current
    standard computer algebra systems like Mathematica or Maple do not
    succeed. We also give examples of how parameter integrals coming from
    the work of other researchers can be solved with the software, e.g.,
    an integral arising in analyzing the entropy of certain processes.",

  abstract = "
    Computing integrals is a common task in many areas of science,
    antiderivatives are one way to accomplish this.  The problem of
    integration in finite terms can be states as follows. Given a
    differential field $(F,D)$ and $f \in F$, compute $g$ in some
    elementary extension of $(F,D)$ such that $Dg = f$ if such a $g$
    exists.

    This problem has been solved for various classes of fields $F$.  For
    rational functions $(C(x), \frac{d}{dx})$ such a $g$ always exists and
    algorithms to compute it are known already for a long time. In 1969
    Risch published an algorithm that solves this problem when $(F,D)$ is
    a transcendental elementary extension of $(C(x),\frac{d}{dx})$. Later
    this has been extended towards integrands being Liouvillian functions
    by Singer et. al. via the use of regular log-explicit extensions of
    $(C(x),\frac{d}{dx})$. Our algorithm extends this to handling
    transcendental Liouvillian extensions $(F,D)$ of $(C,0)$ directly
    without the need to embed them into log-explicit extensions. For
    example, this means that
    \[\int{(z-x)x^{z-1}e^{-x}dx} = x^ze^{-x}\]
    can be computed without including log(x) in the differential field.",

    "In this thesis we cover some aspects of the theory necessary to obtain
    a canonical form for functions obtained by integration and
    exponentiation from the set of rational functions.

    These aspects include a new algorithm for symbolic integration of
    functions involving logarithms and exponentials which avoids
    factorization of polynomials in those cases where algebraic extension
    of the constant field is not required, avoids partial fraction
    decompositions, and only solves linear systems with a small number of
    unknowns.

    We have also found a theorem which states, roughly speaking, that if
    integrals which can be represented as logarithms are represented as
    such, the only algebraic dependence that a new exponential or
    logarithm can satify is given by the law of exponents or the law of
    logarithms.",

    $\int{f}$ of a given function $f$ as a finite combination $g$ of elementary
    functions, or more generally, to determine whether a certain class of
    functions contains an element $g$ such that $g^\prime = f$.

    In the first part of this thesis, we compare different algorithms for
    symbolic integration. Specifically, we review the integration rules
    taught in calculus courses and how they can be used systematically to
    create a reasonable, but somewhat limited, integration method. Then we
    present the differential algebra required to prove the transcendental
    cases of Risch's algorithm. Risch's algorithm decides if the integral
    of an elementary function is elementary and if so computes it. The
    presentation is mostly self-contained and, we hope, simpler than
    previous descriptions of the algorithm. Finally, we describe
    Risch-Norman's algorithm which, although it is not a decision
    procedure, works well in practice and is considerably simpler than the
    full Risch algorithm.

    In the second part of this thesis, we briefly discuss an
    implementation of a computer algebra system and some of the
    experiences it has given us.  We also demonstrate an implementation of
    the rule-based approach and how it can be used, not only to compute
    integrals, but also to generate readable derivations of the results.",

    "In this thesis we address algorithms for polynomial factorisation
    over finite fields. In the univariate case, we study a recent
    algorithm due to Niederreiter where the factorisation problem is
    reduced to solving a linear system over the finite field in question,
    and the solutions are used to produce the complete factorisation of
    the polynomials into irreducibles. We develop a new algorithm for
    solving the linear system using sparse Gaussian elimination with the
    Markowitz ordering strategy, and conjecture that the Niederreiter
    linear system is not only initially sparse, but also preserves its
    sparsity throughout the Gaussian elimination phase. We develop a new
    bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) algorithm base on the approach of
    Gottfert for extracting the factors of a polynomial using a basis of
    the Niederreiter solution set of $\mathbb{F}_2$. We improve upon the
    complexity and performance of the original algorithm, and produce
    binary univariate factorisations of trinomials up to degree 400000.

    We present a new approach to multivariate polynomial factorisation
    which incorporates ideas from polyhedral geometry, and generalises
    Hensel lifting. The contribution is an algorithm for factoring
    bivariate polynomials via polytopes which is able to exploit to some
    extent the sparsity of polynomials. We further show that the polytope
    method can be made sensitive to the number of nonzero terms of the
    input polynomial. We describe a sparse adaptation of the polytope
    method over finite fields of prime order which requires fewer bit
    operations and memory references for polynomials which are known to be
    the product of two sparse factors. Using this method, and to the best
    of our knowledge, we achieve a world record in binary bivariate
    factorisation of a sparse polynomial of degree 20000. We develop a BSP
    variant of the absolute irreducibility testing via polytopes given in
    [45], producing a more memory and run time efficient method that can
    provide wider ranges of applicability. We achieve absolute
    irreducibility testing of a bivariate and trivariate polynomial of
    degree 30000, and of multivariate polynomials with up to 3000
    variables.",

    In considering the reliability of numerical programs, it is normal to
    ``limit our study to the semantics dealing with numerical precision''.
    On the other hand, there is a great deal of work on the reliability of
    programs that essentially ignores the numerics. The thesis of this
    paper is that there is a class of problems that fall between the two,
    which could be described as ``does the low-level arithmetic implement
    the high-level mathematics''. Many of these problems arise because
    mathematics, particularly the mathematics of the complex numbers, is
    more difficult than expected; for example the complex function log is
    not continuous, writing down a program to compute an inverse function
    is more complicated than just solving an equation, and many algebraic
    simplification rules are not universally valid.

    The good news is that these problems are theoretically capable of
    being solved, and are practically close to being solved, but not yet
    solved, in several real-world examples. However, there is still a long
    way to go before implementations match the theoretical possibilities.",

    Previously known algorithms for polynomial square-free decomposition
    rely on greatest common divisor (gcd) computations over the same
    coefficient domain where the decomposition is to be performed. In
    particular, gcd of the given polynomial and its first derivative (with
    respect to some variable) is obtained to begin with. Application of
    modular homomorphism and $p$-adic construction (multivariate case) or
    the Chinese remainder algorithm (univariate case) results in new
    square-free decomposition algorithms which, generally speaking, take
    less time than a single gcd between the given polynomial and its first
    derivative. The key idea is to obtain one or several ``correct''

    For instance we deal with the problem to find all nested sum

    symbolic summation framework to algebraic extensions. These arise, for
    example, when working with expressions involving $(-1)^n$. An
    implementation of this method, including a modernised version of
    Karr's algorithm is presented.

    Karr's algorithm is the summation analogue of the Risch algorithm for
    indefinite integration. In the summation case, towers of specialized
    difference fields called $\prod\sum$-fields are used to model nested
    sums and products. This is similar to the way elementary functions
    involving nested logarithms and exponentials are represented in
    differential fields in the integration case.

    In contrast to the integration framework, only transcendental
    extensions are allowed in Karr's construction. Algebraic extensions of
    $\prod\sum$-fields can even be rings with zero divisors. Karr's
    methods rely heavily on the ability to solve first-order linear
    difference equations and they are no longer applicable over these
    rings.

    Based on Bronstein's formulation of a method used by Singer for the
    solution of differential equations over algebraic extensions, we
    transform a first-order linear equation over an algebraic extension to
    a system of first-order equations over a purely transcendental
    extension field. However, this domain is not necessarily a
    $\prod\sum$-field. Using a structure theorem by Singer and van der
    Put, we reduce this system to a single first-order equation over a
    $\prod\sum$-field, which can be solved by Karr's algorithm. We also
    describe how to construct towers of difference ring extensions on an
    algebraic extension, where the same reduction methods can be used.

    A common bottleneck for symbolic summation algorithms is the
    computation of nullspaces of matrices over rational function
    fields. We present a fast algorithm for matrices over $\mathbb{Q}(x)$
    which uses fast arithmetic at the hardware level with calls to BLAS
    subroutines after modular reduction. This part is joint work with Arne

    We seek to understand a general method for finding a closed form for a
    given sum that acts as its antidifference in the same way that an
    integral has an antiderivative. Once an antidifference is found, then
    given the limits of the sum, it suffices to evaluate the
    antidifference at the given limits. Several algorithms (by Karr and
    Schneider) exist to find antidifferences, but the apers describing
    these algorithms leave out several of the key proofs needed to
    implement the algorithms. We attempt to fill in these gaps and find
    that many of the steps to solve difference equations rely on being
    able to solve two problems: the equivalence problem and the homogenous
    group membership problem. Solving these two problems is essential to
    finding the polynomial degree bounds and denominator bounds for
    solutions of difference equations. We study Karr and Schneider's
    treatment of these problems and elaborate on the unproven parts of
    their work. Section 1 provides background material; section 2 provides
    motivation and previous work; Section 3 provides an outline of Karr's
    Algorithm; section 4 examines the Equivalance Problem, and section 5
    examines the Homogeneous Group Membership Problem. Section 6 presents
    some proofs for the denominator and polynomial bounds used in solving
    difference equations, and Section 7 gives some directions for future

    One of the problems with manipulating function identities in computer
    algebra systems is that they often involve functions which are
    multivalued, whilst most users tend to work with single-valued
    functions.  The problem is that many well-known identities may no
    longer be true everywhere in the complex plane when working with their
    single-valued counterparts. Conversely, we cannot ignore them, since
    in particular contexts they may be valid. We investigate the
    practicality of a method to verify such identities by means of an
    experiment; this is based on a set of test examples which one might
    realistically meet in practice.  Essentially, the method works as
    follows. We decompose the complex plane via means of cylindrical
    algebraic decomposition into regions with respect to the branch cuts
    of the functions. We then test the identity numerically at a sample
    point in the region. The latter step is facilitated by the notion of
    the {\sl adherence} of a branch cut, which was previously introduced
    by the authors. In addition to presenting the results of the
    experiment, we explain how adherence relates to the proposal of 
    {\sl signed zeros} by W. Kahan, and develop this idea further in order to
    allow us to cover previously untreatable cases. Finally, we discuss
    other ways to improve upon our general methodology as well as topics
    for future research.",

    the truth values of certain quantifier free formulae involving
    them. This observation motivates our article and definition of a Truth

    presented an algorithm that can efficiently and directly construct a

    meaning that the formula is either identically true or identically
    false in each cell of the decomposition. The method determines the
    truth of the input formula for each cell of the CAD, and then uses the
    CAD to construct a solution formula -- a quantifier free formula that
    is equivalent to the input formula. This final phase of the algorithm,
    the solution formula construction phase, is the focus of this thesis.

    An optimal solution formula construction algorithm would be {\sl

    this thesis, no method was available with even two of these three

    related to solution formula construction. In combination, these
    provide an efficient and complete method for constructing solution
    formulas that are simple in a variety of ways.

    "The McCallum Projection for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD)
    produces a smaller projection factor set than previous projections,
    however it does not always produce a sign-invariant CAD for the set of
    input polynomials. Problems may arise when a ($k+1$)-level projection
    factor vanishes identically over a k-level cell. According to
    McCallum's paper, when this happens (and $k+1$ is not the highest
    level in the CAD) we do not know whether the projection is valid,
    i.e. whether or not a sign-invariant CAD for the set of input
    polynomials will be produced when lifting is performed in the usual
    way. When the $k$-level cell in question has dimension 0, McCallum
    suggests a modification of the lifting method that will ensure the
    validity of his projection, although to my knowledge this has never
    been implemented.

    In this paper we give easily computable criteria that often allow us
    to conclude that McCallum's projection is valid even though a
    projection factor vanishes identically over a cell. We also improve on
    McCallum's modified lifting method.

    We've incorporated the ideas contained in the paper into QEPCAD, the
    most complete implementation of CAD. When McCallum's projection is
    invalid because of a projection factor not being order-invariant over a
    region on which it vanishes identically, at least a warning message
    ought to be issued. Currently, QEPCAD may print warning messages that
    are not needed, and may fail to print warning messages when they are
    needed. Our implementation in QEPCAD ensures that warning messages are
    printed when needed, and reduces the number of times warning messages
    are printed when not needed. Neither McCallum's modified lifting
    method nor our improvement of it have been implemented in QEPCAD. The
    design of the system would make implementing such a feature quite

    "Cylindrical algebraic decompositions (CADs) are a key tool for
    solving problems in real algebraic geometry and beyond.  We recently
    presented a new CAD algorithm combining two advances: truth-table
    invariance, making the CAD invariant with respect to the truth of
    logical formulae rather than the signs of polynomials; and CAD
    construction by regular chains technology, where first a complex
    decomposition is constructed by refining a tree incrementally by
    constraint. We here consider how best to formulate problems for input
    to this algorithm. We focus on a choice (not relevant for other CAD
    algorithms) about the order in which constraints are presented. We
    develop new heuristics to help make this choice and thus allow the
    best use of the algorithm in practice. We also consider other choices
    of problem formulation for CAD, as discussed in CICM 2013, revisiting
    these in the context of the new algorithm.",

    following useful property: In the case that an element $x$ in
    $GF(2^m)$ is represented by normal bases, $2^k$ power operation of an
    element $x$ in $GF(2^m)$ can be carried out by $k$ times cyclic shift
    of its vector representation.  C.C. Wang et al. proposed an algorithm
    for computing multiplicative inverses using normal bases, which
    requires $(m-2)$ multiplications in $GF(2^m)$ and $(m-1)$ cyclic
    shifts. The fast algorithm proposed in this paper also uses normal
    bases, and computes multiplicative inverses iterating multiplications
    in $GF(2^m)$. It requires at most $2[log_2(m-1)]$ multiplications in
    $GF(2^m)$ and $(m-1)$ cyclic shifts, which are much less than those
    required in Wang's method. The same idea of the proposed fast
    algorithm is applicable to the general power operation in $GF(2^m)$

    "For numerical experiments concerning various problems in a finite
    field $\mathbb{F}_q$ it is useful to have an explicit data
    presentation $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$ of for large $m$, and a method for the
    construction of towers
    \[\mathbb{F}_q \subset \mathbb{F}_{q^{d_1}} \subset \cdots \subset
    \mathbb{F}_{q^{d_k}} = \mathbb{F}_{q^m}\]
    In order to avoid the identification problem it is advantageous to 
    have all fields in the tower presented by properly chosen normal bases, 
    whereby the embedding 
    $\mathbb{F}_{q^{d_i}} \subset \mathbb{F}_{q^{d_{i+1}}}$
    is given by the trace function.
    
    The following notion is introduced: A sequence of polynomials 
    $\{f_n | n \ge 1\}$ with degree$(f_n)=n$ called trace-compatible over 
    $\mathbb{F}_q$ if (1) $f_n$ is a normal polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_q$, 
    (2) if $\alpha_n \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ is a root of $f_n$, then for any 
    proper divisor $d$ of $n$ the trace of $\alpha_n$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ 
    is a root of $f_d$.
    
    The main goal of the dissertation is to give algorithms for
    construction of sequences of trace-compatible polynomials and to
    present explicit numerical data. An analogous notion of
    norm-compatible sequences is also introduced and studied.
    
    The dissertation consists of four chapters and a supplement, as
    follows: (1) Basic notions (1-31). (2) Presentation of the algebraic
    closure of a finite field (32-59). (3) Sequences of polynomials and
    sequences of elements (60-115). (4) Implementations (118-139). (5)
    Supplement (142-171).
    
    In chapters (1)–(3) various known results and algorithms are
    collected, and new results are added and compared with those
    previously used. 
    
    The numerical results in the supplement contain sequences of
    trace-compatible polynomials of degree $n$, where $n \le 100$, and
    $q=2,3,5,7,11,13$. For implementation, the computer-algebra system
    AXIOM has been used. The details contained in this dissertation are

    ``teach'' the computer new simplification rules. Then we report on
    new applications of canonical simplification of rational functions.
    These applications include techniques for picking out coefficients,
    and for substituting for summs, products, quotients, etc. Our final
    essay is on a new, practical, canonical simplification algorithms
    for radical expressions (i.g. algebraic expressions including roots
    of polynomials). The effectiveness of the procedure is assured
    through proofs of appropriate properties of the simplified forms.

    trivial ones. Sometimes the symbolic perspective can provide
    information about questions which cannot be directly answered, or
    questions which might be hard to pose. For example, we might be able
    to analyze the asymptotic behavior of a solution to a differential
    equation even though we cannot solve the equation. One route to
    implicitly solving problems is the use of symmetry arguments. In this
    paper we suggest how, through symmetry, one can solve a large class of
    definite integration problems, including some that we found could not
    be solved by computer algebra systems. One case of symmetry provides
    for recognition of periodicity, and this solves additional problems,

    "In a numerical calculation sometimes we need higher-than
    double-precision floating-point arithmetic to allow us to be confident
    of a result. One alternative is to rewrite the program to use a
    software package implementing arbitrary-precision extended
    floating-point arithmetic such as ARPREC or MPFR, and try to choose a
    suitable precision.  
    
    Such an arithmetic scheme, in spite of helpful tools, may be
    inconvenient to write. There are also facilities in computer algebra
    systems (CAS) for such software-implemented ``bigfloats.'' These
    facilities are convenient if one is already using the CAS. In any of
    these situations the bigfloats may be rather slow, a cost of its
    generality.
    
    There are possibilities intermediate between the largest hardware
    floating-point format and the general arbitrary-precision software
    which combine a considerable (but not arbitrary) amount of extra
    precision with a (relatively speaking) modest factor loss in
    speed. Sometimes merely doubling the number of bits in a
    double-floating-point fraction is enough, in which case arithmetic on
    double-double (DD) operands would suffice. Another possibility is to
    go for yet another doubling to quad-double (QD) arithmetic: instead of
    using the machine double-floats to give about 16 decimal digits of
    precision, QD supplies about 64 digits. DD and QD as used here provide
    the same exponent range as ordinary double.
    
    Here we describe how we incorporated QD arithmetic implemented in a
    library into a Common Lisp system, providing a smooth interface while
    adding only modest overhead to the run-time costs (compared to
    accessing the library from C or C++). One advantage is that we keep
    the program text almost untouched while switching from double to
    quad-double. Another is that the programs can be written, debugged,
    and run in an interactive environment. Most of the lessons from QD can
    be used for other versions of arithmetic which can be embedded in
    Lisp, including MPFR, for indefinite (arbitrary) precision, should QD
    provide inadequate precision or range.",

    some of the usual rational operations can be implemented in

    many times faster than in the conventional representation. Polynomial
    GCD operations, the costliest part of rational additions, are entirely

    "Computer algebra systems (CAS) are supposed to do mathematics. 
    Unfortunately, much of human mathematics presentation and
    manipulation depends on humans to understand what is going on more
    generally. This context is often not made available to the computer
    system, and so it will sometimes fail to make the right guess at the
    meaning of constructions, unless they are made unambiguous. Among many
    issues, one that has been raised and resolved, is the need for
    attributing properties to operators that distinguish between ``the name
    of the operation'' and ``the operation itself''.  
    
    As a simple example, referential transparency requires that if $x = y$,
    then any true statement $P(x)$ about $x$ must be true about $y$, namely
    $P(y)$ is also true.
    
    Consider now the well-known equation $sin(0) = 0$, and the statement 
    $P(r) :=$ ``r = 0 is a rule to simplify the sin() function''.  The
    statement $P(sin(0))$ is clearly true. Therefore $P(0)$ should be true
    as well. It is not, since $0 = 0$ is not a rule to simplify $sin()$.
    
    The point here is that $sin(0)$ is not equal to 0 if sin is treated as
    the name of an operation. Perhaps it is a character string, or a data
    structure of some sort: a noun phrase. The corresponding expression
    including the verb form of sin is one in which $sin(0)$ can be
    simplified to something equivalent, but in some sense preferable. Here
    it is reasonable to replace it by 0.",

    years from the development of its first software systems (the
    now-ancient Macsyma was announced in 1971, and it had precurors.)
    
    Because computers, algorithms, and software systems have advanced so
    substantially, there is a tendency for computer scientists to think
    that all of mathematics can be done by computer, or at least that we
    are on track for the continued ``arithmetization of mathematics.''
    Working mathematicians tend to disagree with the characterization that
    we are at all close now, nor that we are headed toward any goal of
    being able to do or understand mathematics.
    
    Most of the problems which we indicate below are actually quite
    general problems in computer-human communication. For specificity (and
    the possibility that one could qunatify a solution!) we will count our
    discussion of in terms of applications in the area of algebraic
    manipulation. If we cannot handle allegedly well-formed mathematical

    "Programs in symbolic algebraic manipulation systems can compute
    certain classes of symbolic indefinite integrals in closed form. Although
    these answers are ordinarily formally correct algebraic anti-derivatives,
    their form is often unsuitable for further numerical or even analytical 
    processing. In particular, we address cases in which such ``exact answers''
    when numerically evaluated may give less-accurate answers than numerical
    approximations from first principles! The symbolic formulas may also
    behave inappropriately near singularities. We discuss techniques, based
    in part on the calculus of divided differences, for improving the form of
    results of symbolic mathematics systems. In particular, computer alge
    algebra systems must take explicit account of the possibility that they are
    producing not “mathematics” but templates of programs consisting of se
    sequences of arithmetic operations. In brief, mathematical correctness is
    not enough. Forms produced by rational integration programs are used

    "Many ambitious computer algebra systems were initially designed in a
    flush of enthusiasm, with the goal of automating any symbolic
    mathematical manipulation “correctly.” Historically, this approach
    resulted in programs that implicitly used certain identities to
    simplify expressions. These identities, which very likely seemed
    universally true to the programmers in the heat of writing the CAS,
    (and often were true in well-known abstract algebraic domains) later
    needed re-examination when such systems were extended for dealing with
    kinds of objects unanticipated in the original design. These new
    objects are generally introduced to the CAS by extending “generically”
    the arithmetic or other operations.  For example, approximate floats
    do not have the mathematical properties of exact integers or
    rationals.  Complex numbers may strain a system designed for
    real-valued variables. In the situation examined here, we consider two
    categories of “extended” numbers: ∞ or undefined, and real
    intervals. We comment on issues raised by these two troublesome
    notions, how their introduction into a computer algebra system may
    require a (sometimes painful) reconsideration and redesign of parts of
    the program, and how they are related. An alternative (followed most
    notably by the Axiom system is to essentially envision a “meta” CAS
    defined in terms of categories and inheritance with only the most
    fundamental built-in concepts; from these one can build many variants
    of specific CAS features. This approach is appealing but can fails to
    accommodate extensions that violate some mathematical tenets in the

    distinct groups concerned with electronic versions of scientific
    documents:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Publishers of journals, texts, reference works, and their authors.
    \item Software publishers for OCR/document analysis, document formatting
    \item Software publishers whose products access ``contents semantics''
    from documents, including library keyword search programs, natural language
    search programs, data-base systems, visual presentation systems, 
    mathematical computation systems, etc.
    \item Institutions maintain access to electronic libraries, which must
    be broadly construed to include data and programs of all sorts.
    \item Individuals and their programs acting as their agents who need to
    use these libraries, to identify, locate, and retrieive relevant 
    documents
    \end{itemize}
    
    We need to have a convergence in design and standards for encoding new
    or pre-existing (typically paper-based) documents in order to most
    efficiently meet the needs of all these groups. Various effort, some
    loosely coordinated, but just as often competing, are trying to set
    standards and build tools.
    
    We approach this by first dividing the task into visual, syntactic,
    and semantic components. These specifications can focus attention on
    the addressing requirements of the different groups. Additionally, 
    these components rely on a structure for documents that incorporates
    existing library models and extends them to new modes of operation.

    "This paper presents a simple method for converting rational
    parametric equations of curves and surfaces into implicit
    equations. The method proceeds via writing out the implicit polynomial
    $F$ of estimated degree with indeterminate coefficients $u_i$,
    substituting the rational expressions for the given parametric curve
    or surface into $F$ to yield a rational expression $g/h$ in the
    parameter $s$ (or $s$ and $t$), equating the coefficients of $g$ in
    terms of $s$ (and $t$) to 0 to generate a sparse, partially triangular
    system of linear equations in $u_i$ with constant coefficients, and
    finally solving the linear system for ui. If a nontrivial solution is
    found, then an implicit polynomial is obtained; otherwise, one repeats
    the same process, increasing the degree of $F$. Our experiments show
    that this simple method is efficient. It performs particularly well in
    the presence of base points and may detect the dependency of
    parameters incidentally.",

    "How do you solve the equation
    \[1.6^x = 5054.4 - 122.35*x\]
    We will refer to equations of this type, with an exponential
    expression on one side and a linear one on the other, as
    {\sl exponential-linear} equations. Numerical approaches such as Newton’s
    method or bisection quickly lead to accurate approximate solutions of
    exponential-linear equations. But in terms of the elementary functions
    of calculus and college algebra, there is no analytic solution.
    
    One approach to remedying this situation is to introduce a special
    function designed to solve exponential-linear equations. Quadratic
    equations, by way of analogy, are solvable in terms of the special
    function $\sqrt{x}$ , which in turn is simply the inverse of a very
    special and simple quadratic function. Similarly, exponential
    equations are solvable in terms of the natural logarithm {\sl log},
    and that too is the inverse of a very special function. So it is
    reasonable to ask whether there is a special function in terms of
    which exponential-linear equations might be solved. Furthermore, an
    obvious strategy for finding such a function is to invert some simple
    function connected with exponential-linear equations.
    
    This line of thinking proves to be immediately successful, and leads
    to a function I call {\sl glog} (pronounced {\sl gee-log}) which is a
    kind of generalized logarithm. As intended, glog can be used to solve
    exponential-linear equations. But that is by no means all it is good
    for. For example, with glog you can write a closed-form expression for
    the iterated exponential ($x^{x^{x^.}}$), and solve $x + y = x^y$ for
    $y$. The glog function is also closely related to another special
    function, called the Lambert $W$ function in [3] and [6], whose study
    dates to work of Lambert in 1758 and of Euler in 1777. Interesting
    questions about glog arise at every turn, from symbolic integration,
    to inequalities and estimation, to numerical computation. Elaborating
    these points is the goal of this paper.",

  abstract =
    "One of the most classical problems of mathematics is to solve systems
    of polynomial equations in several unknowns. Today, polynomial
    models are ubiquitous and widely applied across the sciences. They
    arise in robotics, coding theory, optimization, mathematical
    biology, computer vision, game theory, statistics, machine learning,
    control theory, and numerous other areas.  The set of solutions to a
    system of polynomial equations is an algebraic variety, the basic
    object of algebraic geometry. The algorithmic study of algebraic 
    varieties is the central theme of computational algebraic
    geometry. Exciting recent developments in symbolic algebra and
    numerical software for geometric calculations have revolutionized
    the field, making formerly inaccessible problems tractable, and
    providing fertile ground for experimentation and conjecture.
    
    The first half of this book furnishes an introduction and represents a
    snapshot of the state of the art regarding systems of polynomial
    equations.  Afficionados of the well-known text books by Cox, Little,
    and O’Shea will find familiar themes in the first five chapters:
    polynomials in one variable, Groebner bases of zero-dimensional
    ideals, Newton polytopes and Bernstein’s Theorem, multidimensional
    resultants, and primary decomposition.
    
    The second half of this book explores polynomial equations from a
    variety of novel and perhaps unexpected angles. Interdisciplinary
    connections are introduced, highlights of current research are
    discussed, and the author’s hopes for future algorithms are
    outlined. The topics in these chapters include computation of Nash
    equilibria in game theory, semidefinite programming and the real
    Nullstellensatz, the algebraic geometry of statistical models, the
    piecewise-linear geometry of valuations and amoebas, and the
    Ehrenpreis-Palamodov theorem on linear partial differential equations
    with constant coefficients.
    
    Throughout the text, there are many hands-on examples and exercises,
    including short but complete sessions in the software systems maple,
    matlab, Macaulay 2, Singular, PHC, and SOStools . These examples
    will be particularly useful for readers with zero background in
    algebraic geometry or commutative algebra. Within minutes, anyone can
    learn how to type in polynomial equations and actually see some
    meaningful results on the computer screen.",

    "Formal power series (FPS) of the form
    $\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{a_k(x-x_0)^k}$ are important in calculus and
    complex analysis.  In some Computer Algebra Systems (CASs) it is
    possible to define an FPS by direct or recursive definition of its
    coefficients.  Since some operations cannot be directly supported
    within the FPS domain, some systems generally convert FPS to finite
    truncated power series (TPS) for operations such as addition,
    multiplication, division, inversion and formal substitution.  This
    results in a substantial loss of information.  Since a goal of
    Computer Algebra is - in contrast to numerical programming - to work
    with formal objects and preserve such symbolic information, CAS should
    be able to use FPS when possible.

    There is a one-to-one correspondence between FPS with positive radius
    of convergence and corresponding analytic functions.  It should be
    possible to automate conversion between these forms.  Among CASs
    only MACSYMA provides a procedure {\tt powerseries} to calculate FPS from
    analytic expressions in certain special cases, but this is rather
    limited.
    
    Here we give an algorithmic approach for computing an FPS for a
    function from a very rich family of functions including all of the
    most prominent ones that can be found in mathematical dictionaries
    except those where the general coefficient depends on the Bernoulli,
    Euler, or Eulerian numbers.  The algorithm has been implemented by the
    author and A.  Rennoch in the CAS MATHEMATICA, and by D.  Gruntz in
    MAPLE.
    
    Moreover, the same algorithm can sometimes be reversed to calculate a
    function that corresponds to a given FPS, in those cases when a
    certain type of ordinary differential equation can be solved.",

    Stoutemyer.
    
    While programs like Derive, Maple, Mathematica and Reduce are very
    powerful, they also have their fair share of problems. In particular,
    branches are somewhat of an Achilles' heel for them. As is well-known,
    the complex logarithm function is properly defined as a
    multiple-valued function. And since the general power and exponential
    functions are defined in terms of the logarithm function, they are
    also multiple-valued. But for actual computations, we need to make
    them single valued, which we do by choosing a branch. In Section 2, we
    will consider some transformation rules for branches of
    multiple-valued complex functions in painstaking detail.
    
    The purpose of this short article is not to do a comprehensive
    comparative study of different computer algebra systems. My goal is
    simply to make the readers aware of some of the problems, and to
    encourage the readers to sit down and experiment with their favourite

    given by parameter integrals. The aim of this presentation is twofold:
    to introduce the reader to some basic ideas of differential algebra in
    the context of integration and to raise awareness in the physics

    "Proving theorems is a creative act demanding new combinations of ideas
    and on occasion new methods of argument. For this reason, theorem
    proving systems need to be extensible. The provers should also remain
    correct under extension, so there must be a secure mechanism for doing
    this. The tactic-style provers pioneered by Edinburgh LCF provide a
    very effective way to achieve secure extensions, but in such systems,
    all new methods must be reduced to tactics. This is a drawback because
    there are other useful proof generating tools such as decision
    procedures; these include, for example, algorithms which reduce a
    deduction problem, such as arithmetic provability, to a computation on
    graphs.

    The Nuprl system pioneered the combination of fixed decision
    procedures with tactics, but the issue of securely adding new ones was
    not solved. In this paper, we show how to safely include user-defined
    decision procedures in theorem provers. The idea is to prove
    properties of the procedure inside the prover’s logic and then invoke
    a reflection rule to connect the procedure to the system. We also show
    that using a rich underlying logic permits an abstract account of the
    approach so that the results carry over to different implementations
    and other logics.",

    "In [Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 28, 457-478 (1975; Zbl 0332.35058)],
    M. E. Taylor described a constructive diagonalization method to
    investigate the reflection of singularities of the solution to
    first-order hyperbolic systems. According to further works initiated
    by Engquist and Majda, this approach proved to be well adapted to the
    construction of artificial boundary conditions. However, in the case
    of systems governed by pseudodifferential operators with variable
    coefficients, Taylor’s method involves very elaborate calculations of
    the symbols of the operators. Hence, a direct approach may be
    difficult when dealing with high-order conditions.

    This motivates the first part of this paper, where a recursive
    explicit formulation of Taylor’s method is stated for microlocally
    strictly hyperbolic systems. Consequently, it provides an algorithm
    leading to symbolic calculations which can be handled by a computer
    algebra system. In the second part, an application of the method is
    investigated for the construction of local radiation boundary
    conditions on arbitrarily shaped surfaces for the transverse electric
    Maxwell system. It is proved that they are of complete order, provided
    the introduction of a new symbols class well adapted to the Maxwell
    system. Next, a complete second-order condition is designed, and when
    used as an on-surface radiation condition [G. A. Kriegsmann,
    A. Taflove, and K. R. Umashankar, IEEE Trans. Antennas Propag. 35,
    153-161 (1987; Zbl 0947.78571)], it can give rise to an ultrafast
    numerical approximate solution of the scattered field.",

    "Within the last few years, there have been numerous applications of
    computer algebra to special functions. G. Gasper (Northwestern
    University) has studied classical hypergeometric functions, and
    W. Gosper (Symbolics, Inc.) has developed a large variety of
    spectacular transformation and summation techniques for MACSYMA. The
    purpose of this note is to explore some of the interface between
    computer algebra and special functions. In section 2 we examine an
    application of MACSYMA which inadequately relied, in my opinion, on
    what was readily available in the literature on hypergeometric
    series. In Section 3 we consider classical observations on sums of
    powers of binomial coefficients. In Section 4 we consdier a problem of
    D.M. Jackson wherein SCRATCHPAD and classical hypergeometric series
    interact nicely. We close with a problem inspired by work in
    statistical mechanics which leads us to question about algorithsm that
    would be useful in computer algebra applications.

    In this brief survey, we have illustrated some of the uses of computer
    algebra. It might be objected that our work could well be carried out
    in almost any computer language; so why bother with SCRATCHPAD? The
    answer, of course, lies in the naturalness and simplicity of computer
    algebra approaches to these problems. Expressions like (2.2), (3.1)
    and (4.1) can be coded in SCRATCHPAD in one line exactly as they are
    written. They can then be studied with minimal thought about the
    computer and maximal concentration on what is happening. Often
    mathematical research consists of sifting low grade ore, and when such
    sifting requires ingenious programming skills it is likely not to be
    carried out.",

    "Algorithms related to the computation of the minimal polynomial of an
    $x\times n$ matrix over a field $K$ are introduced. The complexity of
    the first algorithm, where the complete factorization of the 
    characteristic polynomial is needed, is $O(\sqrt{n}\cdot n^3)$. An
    iterative algorithm for finding the minimal polynomial has complexity
    $O(n^3+n^2m^2)$, where $m$ is a parameter of the shift Hessenberg
    matrix used. The method does not require the knowlege of the
    characteristic polynomial. The average value of $m$ is $O(log n)$.

    Next methods are discussed for finding a cyclic vector for a matrix.
    The authors first consider the case when its characteristic polynomial
    is squarefree. Using the shift Hessenberg form leads to an algorithm
    at cost $O(n^3 + n^2m^2)$. A more sophisticated recurrent procedure
    gives the result in $O(n^3)$ steps. In particular, a normal basis for
    an extended finite field of size $q^n$ will be obtained with complexity
    $O(n^3+n^2 log q)$.

    Finally, the Frobenius form is obtained with asymptotic average
    complexity $O(n^3 log n)$.",

    flexible means of extension and reuse. Theory modules (which are
    called locales) may be extended by definitions and
    theorems. Interpretation of Isabelle's global theories and proof
    contexts is possible via morphisms. Even the locale hierarchy may be
    changed if declared relations between locales do not adequately
    reflect logical relations, which are implied by the locales'
    specifications. By discussing their design and relating it to more
    commonly known structuring mechanisms of programming languages and
    provers, locales are made accessible to a wider audience beyond the
    users of Isabelle. The discussed mechanisms include ML-style functors,

    simpler object-oriented systems, GAP allows method selection based on
    the types of all arguments and on certain aspects of the relationship
    between the arguments. In addition, the type of an object can change,
    in a controlled way, during its life. This reflects information about
    the object which has been computed and stored. Individual methods can
    be written and installed independently. Furthermore, most checking of
    the arguments is done in a uniform way by the method selection system,
    making individual methods simpler and less prone to error. The methods

    "One major goal of symbolic integrators is to determine under what
    circumstances the integral of the elementary functions of calculus can
    themselves be expressed as elementary functions.  While using tables
    and the ad hoc tricks taught in calculus courses can have some limited
    success, a decision procedure is necessary in all but the most trivial
    cases.  The first complete algorithm for solving this problem was
    presented by Risch in 1969, but its complexity, specially when
    algebraic functions are present in the integrand, has prevented it
    from being fully implemented.  Over the past 20 years, the Risch
    integration algorithm has been completed, extended, and improved to
    such a point that recent computer algebra systems can integrate
    elementary functions without using any of the heuristics traditionally
    taught in calculus courses and used by older systems.  In this talk,
    we give an overview and description of the algorithms used in the
    Scratchpad symbolic integrator, and illustrate them with integrals
    drawn from the physical sciences.",

    principal parts of the Laurent series, in particular with the residues
    of the function, without factoring or splitting its denominator. As
    applications, we get a generalisation of the residue formulas used in
    symbolic integration algorithms to $n^{th}$-order formulas. We also
    get an algorithm that computes explicitly the principlal parts at all
    the poles simultaneously, while computing in the field generated by
    the coefficients of the series instead of the one generated by the

    The main new concept we wish to illustrate in this paper is a

    its use in the programming of certain mathematical structures.
    Although this distinction is implicit in much of the programming work
    that has gone into the construction of Axiom categories and domains,
    we believe that a formalisation of this is new, that standards and
    conventions are necessary and will be useful in various other

    explaining the general strategy for solving problems via the Groebner
    approach, we develop the concept of Groebner bases by studying
    uniqueness of polynomial division (``reduction''). For explicitly
    constructing Groebner bases, the crucial notion of S-polynomials is
    introduced, leading to the complete algorithmic solution of the
    construction problem. The algorithm is applied to examples from
    polynomial equation solving and algebraic relations. After a short

    historical remarks and references."

    "On December 30, 2003, Dick Jenks died at the age of 66, after an
    extended and courageous battle with multiple system atrophy.
    
    He received his PhD in mathematics from the University of Illinois at
    Urbana-Champaign in 1966. The title of his dissertation was
    “Quadratic Differential Systems for Mathematical Models” and was
    written under the supervision of Donald Gilles. After completing his
    PhD, he was a post-doctoral fellow at Brookhaven National Laboratory
    on Long Island. In 1968 he joined IBM Research where he worked until
    his retirement in 2002.

    At IBM he was one of the principal architects of the Scratchpad
    system, one of the earliest computer algebra systems(1971). Dick
    always believed that natural user interfaces were essential and
    developed a user-friendly rule-based system for Scratchpad. Although
    this rule-based approach was easy to use, as algorithms for computer
    algebra became more complicated, he began to understand that an
    abstract data type approach would give sophisticated algorithm
    development considerably more leverage. In 1977 he began the Axiom
    development (originally called Scratchpad II) with the design of
    MODLISP, a merger of Lisp with types (modes). In 1980, with the help
    of many others, he completed an initial prototype design based on
    categories and domains that were intended to be natural for
    mathematically sophisticated users.
    
    During this period many researchers in computer algebra visited IBM
    Research in Yorktown Heights and contributed to the development of
    the Axiom system. All this activity made the computer algebra group at
    IBM one of the leading centers for research in this area and Dick was
    always there to organize the visits and provide a stimulating and
    pleasant working environment for everyone. He had a good perspective
    on the most important research directions and worked to attract
    world-renowned experts to visit and interact with his group. He was an
    ideal manager for whom to work, one who always put the project and the
    needs of the group members first. It was a joy to work in such a
    vibrant and stimulating environment.
    
    After many years of development, a decision was made to rename
    Scratch- pad II to Axiom and to release it as a product. Dick and
    Robert Sutor were the primary authors of the book {\sl Axiom: The
    Scientific Computation System}.  In the foreword of the book, written
    by David and Gregory Chudnovsky, it is stated that ``The Scratchpad
    system took its time to blossom into the beautiful Axiom
    product. There is no rival to this powerful environment in its scope
    and, most importantly, in its structure and organization.'' Axiom was
    recently made available as free software. See
    http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom
    
    Dick was active in service to the computer algebra community as
    well. Here are some highlights. He served as Chair of ACM SIGSAM
    (1979-81) and Conference Co-chair (with J. A. van Hulzen) of EUROSAM
    ’84, a precursor of the ISSAC meetings. Dick also had a long period of
    service on the editorial board of the {\sl Journal of Symbolic
    Computation}. At ISSAC ’95 in Montreal, Dick was elected to the
    initial ISSAC Steering Committee and was elected as the second Chair
    of the Committee in 1997. He, along with David Chudnovsky, organized
    the highly successful meetings on Computers and Mathematics that were
    held at Stanford in 1986 and MIT in 1989. As a legacy of those
    meetings, the Jenks Prize for outstanding contributions to software 
    engineering in computer algebra has been established.
    
    Dick had many interests outside of his professional pursuits including
    reading, travel, physical fitness, and especially music. Dick was an
    accomplished pianist, organist, and vocalist. At one point he was the
    organist and choir master of the Church of the Holy Communion in
    Mahopac, NY. In the 1980s and 1990s, he sang in choral groups under
    the direction of Dr. Dennis Keene that performed at Lincoln Center in
    New York city.
    
    Personally, Dick was warm, generous, and outgoing with many
    friends. He will be missed for his technical accomplishments, his
    artist talents, and most of all for his positive, gentle, charming
    spirit.",

    "Let $k$ be a field and $f \in k[x]$ be a polynomial of degree $n$. The
    permutation action of $G$ on the roots $\{\alpha_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of $f$
    can be determined by an algorithm suggested by R. Stauduhar
    [Math. Comput. 27, 981-996 (1973; Zbl 0282.12004)] that approximates $G$
    via successive steps in a chain of subgroups 
    $S_n=H_0 > H_1 > \ldots > H_k=G$. In each step $H_{i-1} > H_i$ 
    it checks as a test for $G \le H_i$ whether a relative invariant $k_i
    \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ yields a value under the specialization
    $\varphi : g(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mapsto g(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)$.  In
    implementations this evaluation has been done using $p$-adic
    [H. Darmon and D. Ford, Commun. Algebra 17, No. 12, 2941-2943 (1989;
    Zbl 0693.12010)] or numerical (R. Stauduhar [ibid.]; Y. Eichenlaub and
    M. Olivier [preprint]) approximation of the roots.
    
    The paper under review presents a new approach which avoids all
    approximations: If $G \le H_i$ and $H_i$ is maximal in $H_{i-1}$ the
    invariant $h_i$ is a primitive element of the invariant field 
    $k_i=k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)^{H_i}$ as an extension of 
    $k_{i-1}=K(x_1,\ldots,x_n)^{H_{i-1}}$.
    The author develops an algorithm to express the specialized values 
    $\varphi(g)$ of elements $g \in k_i$ in terms of $k_{i-1}$ and the 
    specialization $\varphi(h_i)$.
    
    This algorithm then is applied to the relative resolvent polynomial
    \[s_i = \prod_a{(y-a(x_1,\ldots,x_n))}\]
    where $a$ runs through the images of $h_i$ under $H_{i-1}. 
    It has $y$-coefficients which are in $k_{i-1}$. 
    The algorithm then permits to express the coefficients of the
    specialization $r_i(y)=\varphi(s_i) \in k[y]$ recursively in the 
    (already known) specializations $\varphi(h_i)$ for $j \le i-1$,
    using the coefficients of $f$ (as $S_n$-invariants in the roots) 
    as a seed. A root of $r_i(y)$ in the base field then proves that $G$
    is contained in (a conjugate of) $H_i$, and this value of the root can 
    be used as specialized $\varphi(h_{i+1})$ in the next step of the 
    algorithm. Special care is given to the case when denominators of 
    elements in $k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ evaluate to zero after specialization.
    
    The paper closes with a short discussion of applicability. An
    implementation using AXIOM and GAP is in process but has not yet been
    completed.",

    $F_i({\bf X}) \in k[{\bf X}]$, where $k$ is a commutative field and

    of $GL_n(k)$. A polynomial $P \in k[{\bf X}]$ (resp. rational function 
    $P \in k({\bf X})$ ) is an invariant of $G$ if and only if for all

    $G \subset L$, $P$ is called a primary invariant of $G$ relative to $L$ if 
    and only if $Stab_L(P) = G$ (where $Stab_L(P)$ is the stabilizer of 
    $P$ in $L$).

    The paper describes the algebra of the invariants of a finite group
    and how to express these invariants in terms of a small number of
    them, from both the Cohen-Macaulay algebra and the field theory points
    of view. A method is proposed to solve $(F)$ by expressing it in terms of
    primary invariants $\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n$
    (e.g. the elementary symmetric polynomials) and one
    ``primitive'' secondary invariant.
    
    The main thrust of the paper is contained in the following theorem. 
    Let $(F)$ be a set of invariants of $G$. Let $L$ be a subgroup of 
    $GL_n(k)$ such that $G \subset L$ and $k({\bf X})^L$ is a purely 
    transcendental extension of $k_i$, let $\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n$ be 
    polynomials such that $k({\bf X})^L = k(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n)$,
    and let $\Theta \in k[{\bf X}]^G$ be a primitive polynomial invariant 
    of $G$ relative to $L$.
    When possible, it is convenient to choose $\Theta$ to be one of the
    polynomials in $(F)$. – An algorithm is given that allows each polynomial
    $F_i$ to be expressed as $F_i({\bf X}) = H_i(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n,\Theta)$, 
    an algebraic fraction in $\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n$ and a polynomial in
    $\Theta$. Now let $L$ be the minimal polynomial of $\Theta$ over 
    $k[{\bf X}]^L$; we have 
    \[L({\bf X},T)=\prod_{\Theta^{'} \in L\cdot \Theta}(T-\Theta^{'})
    \in k[{\bf X}]^L[T]\]
    (where $L$ is called a generic Lagrange resolvent). 
    As $k(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n)=k({\bf X})^L$, we can write 
    $L({\bf X},T)=H_0(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n,T)$ where $H_0$ is some
    rational function. The question 
    $H_0(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n,\Theta)=0$ is always satisfied because 
    $\Theta$ is a root of $L$. Then, we solve the system of ($p=1$) 
    algebraic equations $H_i(\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n,\Theta)=0$,
    $0 \le i \le p$ for $\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n,\Theta$ as indeterminates.
    
    Theorem 1: Let $D \in k[\Pi_1,\cdots,\Pi_n]$ be the LCM of the 
    denominators of all the fractions $H_i$,$0 \le i \le p$ and let 
    $H_i^{'}=DH_i$. For every solution 
    $x:=(x_1,\cdots,x_n)$ of the system $(F)$:$F_i({\bf X})=0$,
    $1 \le i \le p$, there exists a solution ($\pi_1,\cdots,\pi_n,\Theta$)
    of the system

    that $x$ is a solution of the system 
    $(P_\pi):\Pi_i({\bf X})=\pi_i$, $1 \le i \le n$ , and of the equation 
    $\Theta({\bf X})=0$. Conversely, for any solution 
    $(\pi_1,\cdots,\pi_n,\theta)$ of the system $(H^{'})$ such that 
    $D(\pi_1,\cdots,\pi_n) \ne 0$, if $x$ is a solution of the system 
    $(P_\pi)$ relative to $(\pi_1,\cdots,\pi_n)$, then there exists 
    some $A \in L$ such that $\Theta(A\cdot x)=\theta$, and then for all 
    $B \in G$, $BA\cdot x$, is a solution of the system $(F)$.
    
    A slighly more general version of this theorem is also given. The
    paper then presents an algorithm that applies the theory and has been
    implemented in AXIOM. It is followed by several examples.",

    It is well-known that few object-oriented programming languages allow

    object-oriented programming languages to reflect the dynamic nature of
    problems, particularly those arising in a mathematical context. It is

    "Around 1980 two new directions in science and technique came
    together. One was Buchberger’s algorithms in order to handle Groebner
    bases in an effective way for solving polynomial equations. The second
    one was the development of the personal computers. This was the
    starting point of a computational perspective in commutative algebra
    and algebraic geometry. In 1991 the three authors invented the first
    edition of their book as an introduction for undergraduates to some
    interesting ideas in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry with a
    strong perspective to practical and computational aspects. A second
    revised edition appeared in 1996. That means from the very beginning
    the book provides a bridge for the new, computational aspects in the
    field of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

    To be more precise, the book gives an introduction to Buchberger’s
    algorithm with applications to syzygies, Hilbert polynomials, primary
    decompositions. There is an introduction to classical algebraic
    geometry with applications to the ideal membership problem, solving
    polynomial equations, and elimination theory. Some more spectacular
    applications are about robotics, automatic geometric theorem proving,
    and invariants of finite groups. It seems to the reviewer to carry
    coals to Newcastle for estimating the importance and usefulness of the
    book. It should be of some interest to ask how many undergraduates
    have been introduced to algorithmic aspects of commutative algebra and
    algebraic geometry following the line of the book. The reviewer will
    be sure that this will continue in the future too.  

    What are the changes to the previous editions? There is a significant
    shorter proof of the Extension Theorem, see 3.6 in Chapter 3,
    suggested by A.H.M. Levelt. A major update has been done in Appendix C
    ``Computer Algebra Systems''. This concerns in the main the section
    about MAPLE. Some minor updated information concern the use of AXIOM,
    CoCoA, Macaulay2, Magma, Mathematica, and SINGULAR. This reflects
    about the recent developments in Computer Algebra Systems. It
    encourages an interested reader to more practical exercises. The
    authors have made changes on over 200 pages to enhance clarity and
    correctness. Many individuals have reported typographical errors and
    gave the authors feedback on the earlier editions. The book is
    well-written. The reviewer guesses that it will become more and more
    difficult to earn 1 dollar (sponsored by the authors) for every new
    typographical error as it was the case also with the first and second
    edition. The reviewer is sure that it will be a excellent guide to
    introduce further undergraduates in the algorithmic aspect of
    commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.",

    surprised. As is often the case, the computerization of
    mathematical computation in computer algebra systems on the one
    hand, and mathematical reasoning in theorem provers on the other
    hand, forces us to explore the issue of equality in greater
    detail.In practice, there are also several ambiguities in the
    definition of equality. For example, we refer to $\mathbb{Q}(x)$
    as ``rational functions'', even though $\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}$ and
    $x+1$ are not equal as functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to
    $\mathbb{R}$, since the former is not defined at $x=1$, even
    though they are equal as elements of $\mathbb{Q}(x)$. The aim of
    this paper is to point out some of the problems, both with
    mathematical equality and with data structure equality, and to
    explain how necessary it is to keep a clear distintion between the two.",

    This paper explains how Scratchpad solves the problem of presenting a
    categorical view of factorization in unique factorization domains,
    i.e.  a view which can be propagated by functors such as
    SparseUnivariatePolynomial or Fraction. This is not easy, as the
    constructive version of the classical concept of
    UniqueFactorizationDomain cannot be so propagated. The solution
    adopted is based largely on Seidenberg's conditions (F) and (P), but
    there are several additional points that have to be borne in mind to
    produce reasonably efficient algorithms in the required generality.

    The consequence of the algorithms and interfaces presented in this
    paper is that Scratchpad can factorize in any extension of the
    integers or finite fields by any combination of polynomial, fraction
    and algebraic extensions: a capability far more general than any other
    computer algebra system possesses. The solution is not perfect: for
    example we cannot use these general constructions to factorize
    polyinmoals in $\overline{Z[\sqrt{-5}]}[x]$ since the domain
    $Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a unique factorization domain, even though
    $\overline{Z[\sqrt{-5}]}$ is, since it is a field. Of course, we can
    factor polynomials in $\overline{Z}[\sqrt{-5}][x]$",

    This paper explains how Scratchpad solves the problem of presenting a
    categorical view of factorization in unique factorization domains,
    i.e.  a view which can be propagated by functors such as
    SparseUnivariatePolynomial or Fraction. This is not easy, as the
    constructive version of the classical concept of
    UniqueFactorizationDomain cannot be so propagated. The solution
    adopted is based largely on Seidenberg's conditions (F) and (P), but
    there are several additional points that have to be borne in mind to
    produce reasonably efficient algorithms in the required generality.

    The consequence of the algorithms and interfaces presented in this
    paper is that Scratchpad can factorize in any extension of the
    integers or finite fields by any combination of polynomial, fraction
    and algebraic extensions: a capability far more general than any other
    computer algebra system possesses. The solution is not perfect: for
    example we cannot use these general constructions to factorize
    polyinmoals in $\overline{Z[\sqrt{-5}]}[x]$ since the domain
    $Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ is not a unique factorization domain, even though
    $\overline{Z[\sqrt{-5}]}$ is, since it is a field. Of course, we can
    factor polynomials in $\overline{Z}[\sqrt{-5}][x]$",

    "Dynamic evaluation is a general method for computing with parameters
    [6, 9]. In 1994, T. Gomez-Diaz implemented the dynamic constructible
    closure in the scientific computation system Axiom [17]: by simulating
    dynamic evaluation, it offers the possibility to compute with
    parameters in a very large way [13]. The outputs of a calculs with
    T. Gomez-Diaz programs are represented by a finite collection of
    constructible triangular systems defined in [12, definition
    p.106]. Though there are numerous applications of these programs
    (notably polynomial system solving with parameters [11], automatic
    geometric theorem proving [14, 15], computation of Jordan forms with
    parameters [16]), nobody gives theorical interest to this kind of
    triangular systems. The main reason of this phenomenon is that they
    are definied in [12] within the dynamic evaluation context. On the
    opposite, most notions of triangular systems (J.F. Ritt-W.T. Wu
    characteristic sets [24, 28], M. Kalkbrener regular chains [18],
    D. Lazard triangular sets [20], M. Moreno Maza regular sets [22],
    D.M. Wang simple systems [26, 27]) are defined in terms of commutative
    algebra. This problem is at the origin of the work done in [7] where
    we give a relevant algebraic model of T. Gomez-Diaz systems within
    commutative algebra terminology. This allows us to relate them to many
    concepts of triangular systems [7]. Thus, we give interest to the
    connections with D. Lazard triangular sets in [8]. In a way, this
    paper is the continuation of this previous work. This time, we study
    relationships between T. Gomez-Diaz systems and D.M. Wang simple
    systems. The paper is structured as follows. We have collected in
    section 2 some needed notations. In section 3, we give all the
    terminology related to our algebraic model of T. Gomez-Diaz
    systems. Thus, we define the notion of weak constructible triangular
    systems and introduce the properties of normalization and
    squarefreeness. Section 4 is more detailed.  First of all, we study a
    weaker form of normalization called $L$-normalization. Then we give
    many properties of constructible triangular systems verifying this new
    notion. We obtain an algebraic and geometric framework which permits,
    in section 5, to explore the connections between T. Gomez-Diaz systems
    and D.M. Wang simple systems. In particular, this last section will
    demonstrate well the importance of our $L$-normalization
    property. Indeed, we show that simple systems and squarefree
    $L$-normalized constructible triangular systems are equivalent.",

  abstract = 
    "A survey of symbolic methods for factoring linear differential
    operators is given. Starting from basic notions – ring of operators,
    differential Galois theory – methods for finding rational and
    exponential solutions that can provide first order right-hand factors
    are considered. Subsequently several known algorithms for
    factorization are presented. These include Singer’s eigenring
    factorization algorithm, factorization via Newton polygons, van
    Hoeij’s methods for local factorization, and an adapted version of
    Pade approximation.
    
    In addition a procedure based on pure algebraic methods for factoring
    second order linear partial differential operators is
    developed. Splitting an operator of this kind reduces to solving a
    system of linear algebraic equations. Those solutions which satisfy a
    certain different ial condition, immediately produce linear factors of
    the operator. The method applies also to operators of third order,
    thereby resulting in a more complicated system of equations. In
    contrast to the second order case, differential equations must also be
    solved, which, in particular cases, are simplified with the aid of
    characteristic sets.
    
    Finally, complete decomposition into linear factors of ordinary
    differential operators of arbitrary order is discussed. A splitting
    formula is developed, provided that a linear basis of solutions is
    available.  This theoretical representation is valuable in
    understanding the nature of the classical Beke algorithm and its
    variants like the algorithm LODEF by Schwarz and the Beke-Bronstein
    algorithm.",

    constructs a given model of subtyping, which is established by a
    monotonic (covariant) subtyping rule. Type safeness of language
    instructions is proved.
    
    The adoption of {\sl ESI} allows to model method and class
    specialization in a natural way. The {\sl ESI} mechanism verifies the
    type correctness of language statements by means of type checking
    rules and preserves their correctness at run-time by a suitable method

    "Many problems in computer algebra, as well as in high-school
    exercises, are such that their statement only involves integers but
    their solution involves complex numbers. For example, the complex
    numbers $\sqrt{2}$ and $-\sqrt{2}$ appear in the solutions of
    elementary problems in various domains. 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item in {\bf integration}:
    \[\int{\frac{dx}{x^2-2}} = \frac{Log(x-\sqrt{2})}{2\sqrt{2}}
    +\frac{Log(x-(-\sqrt{2}))}{2(-\sqrt{2})}\]

    \[\left(\begin{array}{cc}
    1 & 1\\
    1 & -1

    $y^2+x^2=1$ at the points
    \[(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2}) {\rm\ and\ }(-\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2})\]
    \end{itemize}
    Of course, more ``complicated'' complex numbers appear in more
    complicated examples.

    But two facts have to be emphasized:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item in general, if a problem is stated over the integers (or over
    the field $\mathbb{Q}$ of rational numbers), the complex numbers that
    appear are {\sl algebraic} complex numbers, which means that they are
    roots of some polynomial with rational coefficients, like $\sqrt{2}$
    and $-\sqrt{2}$ are roots of $T^2-2$.
    \item Similar problems appear with base fields different from
    $mathbb{Q}$. For example finite fields, or fields of rational
    functions over $\mathbb{Q}$ or over a finite field. The general
    situation is that a given problem is stated over some ``small field''
    $K$, and its solution is expressed in an {\sl algebraic closure}
    $\overline{K}$ of $K$, which means that this solution involves numbers
    which are roots of polynomials with coefficients in $K$.
    \end{itemize}

    The aim of this paper is to describe an implementation of an algebraic
    closure domain constructor in the language Scratchpad II, simply
    called Scratchpad below. In the first part we analyze the problem, and
    in the second part we describe a solution based on the D5 system.",

    "Computer algebra systems are large collections of routines for solving
    mathematical problems algorithmically, efficiently and above all,
    symbolically. The more advanced and rigorous computer algebra systems
    (for example, Axiom) use the concept of strong types based on
    order-sorted algebra and category theory to ensure that operations are
    only applied to expressions when they ``make sense''.

    In cases where Axiom uses notions which are not covered by current
    mathematics we shall present new mathematics which will allow us to
    prove that all such cases are reducible to cases covered by the
    current theory. On the other hand, we shall also point out all the
    cases where Axiom deviates undesirably from the mathematical ideal.
    Furthermore we shall propose solutions to these deviations.

    Strongly typed systems (especially of mathematics) become unusable
    unless the system can change the type in a way a user expects. We wish
    any change expected by a user to be automated, ``natural'', and
    unique. ``Coercions'' are normally viewed as ``natural type changing
    maps''. This thesis shall rigorously define the word ``coercion'' in
    the context of computer algebra systems.

    We shall list some assumptions so that we may prove new results so
    that all coercions are unique. This concept is called ``coherence''.

    We shall give an algorithm for automatically creating all coercions in
    type system which adheres to a set of assumptions. We shall prove that
    this is an algorithm and that it always returns a coercion when one
    exists. Finally, we present a demonstration implementation of this
    automated coerion algorithm in Axiom.",

    "In applied mathematics, electronic and chemical engineering, the
    modelling process can produce a number of mathematical problems which
    require numerical solutions for which symbolic methods are either not
    possible or not obvious. With the plethora of numerical library
    routines for the solution of these problems often the numerical
    analyst has to answer the question {\sl Which routine to choose?} and
    {\sl How do I use it?}. Some analysis needs to be carried out before
    the appropriate routine can be identifed, i.e. {\sl How stiff is this
    ODE?} and {\sl Is this function continuous?}. It may well be the case
    that more than one routine is applicable to the problem. So the
    question may become {\sl Which is likely to be the best?}. Such a
    choice may be critical for both accuracy and efficiency.
    
    An expert system is thus required to make this choice based on the
    results of its own analysis of the problem, call the routine and act
    on the outcome. This may be to put the answer in a relevant form or
    react to an apparent failure of the chosen routine and thus choose and
    call an alternative. It should also have sufficient explanation
    mechanisms to inform on the choice of routine and the reasons for that

    "One of the basic techniques in every mathematician's toolkit is the
    Taylor series representation of functions. It is of such fundamental
    importance and it is so well understood that its use is often a first
    choice in numerical analysis. This faith has not, unfortunately, been
    transferred to the design of computer algorithms.
    
    Approximation by use of Taylor series methods is inherently partly a
    symbolic process and partly numeric> This aspect has often, with
    reason, been regared as a major hindrance in algorithm design. Whilst
    attempts have been made in the past to build a consistent set of
    programs for the symbolic and numeric paradigms, these have been
    necessarily multi-stage processes.
    
    Using current technology it has at last become possible to integrate
    these two concepts and build an automatic adaptive symbolic-numeric
    algorithm within a uniform framework which can hide the internal
    workings behind a modern interface.",

    Compuer Algebra Systems use generic names for each problem area. For

    use different names for each method together with a variety of extra

    "In the recent decades, it has been more and more realized that
    computers are of enormous importance for numerical
    computations. However, these powerful general-purpose machines can
    also be used for transforming, combining and computing symbolic
    algebraic expressions. In other words, computers can not only deal
    with numbers, but also with abstract symbols representing mathematical
    formulas. This fact has been realized much later and is only now
    gaining acceptance among mathematicians and engineers. [Franz Winkler,
    1996].
    
    Computer Algebra is that field of computer science and mathematics,
    where computation is performed on symbols representing mathematical
    objects rather than their numeric values.
    
    This thesis attempts to present a definition of computer algebra by
    means of a survey of its main topics, together with its major
    application areas. The survey includes necessary algebraic basics and
    fundamental algorithms, essential in most computer algebra problems,
    together with some problems that rely heavily on these algorithms. The
    set of applications, presented from a range of fields of engineering
    and science, although very short, indicates the applied nature of
    computer algebra systems.
    
    A recent research area, central in most computer algebra software
    packages and in geometric modeling, is the implicitization
    problem. Curves and surfaces are naturally reperesented either
    parametrically or implicitly. Both forms are important and have their
    uses, but many design systems start from parametric
    representations. Implicitization is the process of converting curevs
    and surfaces from parametric form into implicit form.
    
    We have surveyed the problem of implicitization and investigated its
    currently available methods. Algorithms for such methods have been
    devised, implemented and tested for practical examples. In addition, a
    new method has been devised for curves for which a direct method is
    not available. The new method has been called {\sl near implicitization}
    since it relies on an approximation of the input problem. Several
    variants of the method try to compromise between accuracy and
    complexity of the designed algorithms.
    
    The problem of implicitization is an active topic where research is
    still taking place.  Examples of further research points are included
    in the conclusion",

    context for both deduction and computation. The framework includes
    facilities for deriving theorems via a mixture of deduction and
    computation, constructing sound deduction and computation rules, and
    developing networks of biform theories linked by interpretations. The
    framework is not tied to a specific underlying logic; indeed, it is

    "Ideally the transformations performed by MACSYMA's simplification
    program on algebraic expressions correspond to those simplifications
    desired by each user and each program.  Since it is impossible for a
    program to intuit all users' requirements simultaneously, explicit
    control of the simplifier is necessary to override default
    transformations.  A model of the simplification process is helpful in
    controlling this large and complex program.
    
    Having examined several algebraic simplification programs, it appears
    that to date no program has been written which combines a conceptually
    simple and useful view of simplification with a program nearly as
    powerful as MACSYMA's.  {note, 1979. not clear this would be different
    in 2001.  RJF} Rule-directed transformation schemes struggle to
    approach the power of the varied control structures in more usual
    program schemes [Fenichel, 68].  {note, Mathematica pushes rules
    further. RJF}
    
    It is our belief that a thorough grasp of the decision and data
    structures of the MACSYMA simplifier program itself is the most direct
    way of understanding its potential for algebraic expression
    transformation.  This is an unfortunate admission to have to make, but
    it appears to reflect the state of the art in dealing with
    formalizations of complex programs.  Simplification is a perplexing
    task.  Because of this, we feel it behooves the ``guardians of the
    simplifier'' to try to meet the concerned MACSYMA users part-way by
    documenting the program as it has evolved.  We hope this paper
    continues to grow to reflect a reasonably accurate, complete, and
    current description.
    
    Of course Lisp program details are available to the curious, but even
    for those without a working knowledge of the Lisp language (in which
    the simplifier is written) we expect this paper to be of some help in
    answering questions which arise perennially as to why MACSYMA deals
    with some particular class of expressions in some unanticipated
    fashion, or is inefficient in performing some set of transformations.
    Most often difficulties such as these are accounted for by implicit
    design decisions which are not evident from mere descriptions of what
    is done in the anticipated and usual cases.  We also hope that
    improvements or revisions of the simplifier will benefit from the more
    centralized treatment of issues given here.  We also provide
    additional commentary which reflects our current outlook on how
    simplification programs should be written, and what capabilities they
    should have.",

  title = "Building Algebra Systems by Overloading Lisp",
  url = "http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/generic/overload-small.pdf",
  abstract = "
    Some of the earliest computer algebra systems (CAS) looked like
    overloaded languages of the same era. FORMAC, PL/I FORMAC, Formula
    Algol, and others each took advantage of a pre-existing language base
    and expanded the notion of a numeric value to include mathematical
    expressions. Much more recently, perhaps encouraged by the growth in
    popularity of C++, we have seen a renewal of the use of overloading to
    implement a CAS.

    This paper makes three points. 1. It is easy to do overloading in
    Common Lisp, and show how to do it in detail. 2. Overloading per se
    provides an easy solution to some simple programming problems. We show
    how it can be used for a ``demonstration'' CAS. Other simple and
    plausible overloadings interact nicely with this basic system. 3. Not
    all goes so smoothly: we can view overloading as a case study and
    perhaps an object lesson since it fails to solve a number of
    fairly-well articulated and difficult design issues in CAS for which
    other approaches are preferable.",

    set of data layouts for symbolic or mathematical algebraic expressions
    intended for use by built-in or user-written programs. The CAS cannot
    build in all plausible data designs, but supports those of most
    interest to the programmers. In such a situation it is almost
    inevitable that some new data encoding idea will come to mind and with
    it an interest in adding additional data forms. The motivation may be
    for compact representation, or efficient (fast) manipulation, or for
    other reasons such as interchange with other programs. Most CAS
    therefore include at least one way to extend the base set of
    operations. We comment on the kinds of extensions possible, using
    Macsyma as an example CAS. The particular interest in Macsyma and its
    open-source soruceforge variant ``Maxima'' is that a substantial group
    of very-losely coupled independent researchers are approaching this

  abstract = "
    One of the main strengths of computer algebra is being able to solve a
    family of problems with one computation. In order to express not only
    one problem but a family of problems, one introduces some symbols
    which are in fact the parameters common to all the problems of the
    family.

    The user must be able to understand in which way these parameters
    affect the result when he looks at the answer. Otherwise it may lead
    to completely wrong calculations, which when used for numerical
    applications bring nonsensical answers. This is the case in most
    current Computer Algebra Systems we know because the form of the
    answer is never explicitly conditioned by the values of the
    parameters. The user is not even informed that the given answer may be
    wrong in some cases then computer algebra systems can not be entirely
    trustworthy. We have introduced multi-valued expressions called {\sl
    conditional} expressions, in which each potential value is associated
    with a condition on some parameters. This is used, in particular, to
    capture the situation in integration, where the form of the answer can
    depend on whether certain quantities are positive, negative or
    zero. We show that it is also necessary when solving modular linear
    equations or deducing congruence conditions from complex expressions.",

                 following paper defines a semantics for a subproblem,
                 namely coercion, which is based on rewrite rules. From
                 this definition, an efficient coercion algorithm for
                 Scratchpad is constructed using graph techniques.",

    "Machine element analysis has a goal of describing function and other

    how ideas from object-oriented modelling can be applied to machine
    elment analysis. The models thus obtained are both easier to
    understand, better structured, and allow a higher degree of re-use
    than conventional models. An object-oriented model description is
    natural and suitable for machine element analysis. As a realistic
    example an equational model of rolling bearings is presented. The
    structure of the model is general, and applies to many types of
    rolling bearings. The model and one solution require approximately
    200+200 equations. The model is extensible, e.g. simple submodels of
    detailed properties can be made more complex without altering the
    overall structure. The example model has been implemented in a
    language of our own design. ObjectMath (Object-oriented Mathematical
    language for scientific computing). Using ObjectMath, it is possible
    to model classes of equation objects, to support multiple and single
    inheritance of equations, to support composition of equations, and to
    solve systems of equations. Algebraic transformations can conveniently
    be done since ObjectMath models are translated into the Mathematica
    computer algebra language. When necessary, equations can be
    transformed int C++ code for efficient numerical solution. The re-use
    of equations through inheritance reduced the size of the model by a
    factor of two, compared to a direct representation of the model in the
    Mathematica computer algebra language.",

    "Computer Algebra (CA) is the name given to the discipline of
    algebraic, rather than numerical, computation. There are a number of
    computer programs – Computer Algebra Systems (CASs) – available for
    doing this. The most widely used general-purpose systems that are
    currently available commercially are Axiom, Derive, Macsyma, Maple,
    Mathematica and REDUCE. The discipline of computer algebra began in
    the early 1960s and the first version of REDUCE appeared in 1968.
    
    A large class of mathematical problems can be solved by using a CAS
    purely interactively, guided only by the user documentation. However,
    sophisticated use requires an understanding of the considerable amount
    of theory behind computer algebra, which in itself is an interesting
    area of constructive mathematics. For example, most systems provide
    some kind of programming language that allows the user to expand or
    modify the capabilities of the system.
    
    This book is probably the most general introduction to the theory of
    computer algebra that is written as a textbook that develops the
    subject through a smooth progression of topics. It describes not only
    the algorithms but also the mathematics that underlies them. The book
    provides an excellent starting point for the reader new to the
    subject, and would make an excellent text for a postgraduate or
    advanced undergraduate course. It is probably desirable for the reader
    to have some background in abstract algebra, algorithms and
    programming at about second-year undergraduate level.
    
    The book introduces the necessary mathematical background as it is
    required for the algorithms. The authors have avoided the temptation
    to pursue mathematics for its own sake, and it is all sharply focused
    on the task of performing algebraic computation. The algorithms are
    presented in a pseudo-language that resembles a cross between Maple
    and C. They provide a good basis for actual implementations although
    quite a lot of work would still be required in most cases. There are
    no code examples in any actual programming language except in the
    introduction.
    
    The authors are all associated with the group that began the
    development of Maple. Hence, the book reflects the approach taken by
    Maple, but the majority of the discussion is completely independent of
    any actual system. The authors’ experience in implementing a practical
    CAS comes across clearly.
    
    The book focuses on the core of computer algebra. The first chapter
    introduces the general concept and provides a very nice historical
    survey. The next three chapters discuss the fundamental topics – data
    structures, representations and the basic arithmetic of integers,
    rational numbers, multivariate polynomials and rational functions – on
    which the rest of the book is built.
    
    A major technique in CA involves projection onto one or more
    homomorphic images, for which the ground ring is usually chosen to be
    a finite field. The image solution is lifted back to the original
    problem domain by means of the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the case
    of multiple homomorphic images, or the Hensel (-adic or ideal-adic)
    construction in the case of a single image. The next two chapters are
    devoted to these techniques in a fairly general setting. The two
    subsequent chapters specialise them to GCD computation and
    factorisation for multivariate polynomials; the first of these
    chapters also discusses the important but difficult topic of
    subresultants.
    
    The next two chapters describe the use of fraction-free Gaussian
    elimination, resultants and Gröbner Bases for manipulation and exact
    solution of linear and nonlinear polynomial equations. The two final
    chapters describe ``classical'' algorithms and the more recent Risch
    algorithm for symbolic indefinite integration, and provide an
    introduction to differential algebra.
    
    The book does not consider more specialised problem areas such as
    symbolic summation, definite integration, differential equations,
    group theory or number theory. Nor does it consider more applied
    problem areas such as vectors, tensors, differential forms, special
    functions, geometry or statistics, even though Maple and other CASs
    provide facilities in all or many of these areas. It does not consider
    questions of CA programming language design, nor any of the important
    but non-algebraic facilities provided by current CASs such as their
    user interfaces, numerical and graphical facilities.
    
    This is a long book (nearly 600 pages); it is generally very well
    presented and the three authors have merged their contributions
    seamlessly. I noticed very few typographical errors, and none of any
    consequence. I have only two complaints about the book. The typeface
    is too small, particularly for the relatively large line spacing used,
    and it is much too expensive, particularly for a book that would
    otherwise be an excellent student text. I recommend it highly to
    anyone who can afford it.",

    "One of the most important applications of Buchberger's algorithm for
    Groebner basis computation is the solution of systems of polynomial
    equations (having finitely many roots), i.e. the computation of zeros
    of 0-dimensional polynomial ideals. It is based on a relation between
    Groebner bases w.r.t. a lexicographical ordering and elimination
    ideals, which was discovered by Trinks.

    Packages for isolation of real roots of systems of polynomial
    equations using Groebner basis computation are currently available in
    different computer algebra systems, including SAC-2, Reduce,
    Scratchpad II, Maple.
    
    In principle, Buchberger-Trinks algorithm should allow to compute
    solutions of such systems in the algebraic closure of the coefficient
    field $k$ (usually the rational numbers), in the sense that it is
    possible to represent explicitly a finite extension of $k$ containing
    all solutions and to express the roots in this field.
    
    However, this requires several factorisations of polynomials over a
    tower of algebraic extensions of $k$, which is usually very costly, so
    that the resulting algorithm is not very feasible and, as far as we
    know, no implementation is available.
    
    The results of [GT2] on primary decomposition of ideals include a
    thorough study on the structure of Groebner bases for 0-dimensional
    ideals; in particular, the paper shows, that after a ``generic''
    linear change of coordinates, the roots of a system of polynomial
    equations can be expressed in a simple extension of $k$. Therefore, in
    this case, no factorisation of polynomials over towers of algebraic
    extensions is needed.
    
    However performing a change of coordinates has the undesirable effects
    of introducing dense polynomials and of increasing the size of
    coefficients.
    
    The problem then arises of producing strategies to compute Groebner
    bases for (0-dimensional) ideals, which at least are able to control
    the influence of these side-effects: two such strategies are presented
    in this paper, together with the application to the present problem of
    an algorithm by Gianni that computes the radical of a 0-dimensional
    ideal after a ``generic'' change of coordinates.
    
    A different approach, based on her ``splitting algorithm'', to compute
    solutions of systems of polynomial equations without the need of
    polynomial factorisations has been proposed by D. Duval; also her
    algorithm should be simplified by a ``generic'' change of coordinates.
    
    The algorithms discussed in this paper are implemented in SCRATCHPAD II.
    
    In the first section we recall some well-known properties of Groebner
    bases and properties on the structure of Groebner bases of
    zero-dimensional ideals from [GT2]; in the second section we recall
    the Groebner basis algorithm for solving systems of algebraic
    equations.
    
    The original results are contained in Sections 3 to 5; in Section 3 we
    take advantage of the obvious fact that density can be controlled by
    performing ``small'' changes of coordinates: we show that such
    approach is possible during a Groebner basis computation, in such a
    way that computations done before a change of coordinates are valid
    also after it; in Section 4 we propose a ``linear algebra'' approach
    to obtain the Groebner basis w.r.t the lexicographical ordering from
    the one w.r.t the total-degree ordering; in Section 5, we present a
    zero-dimensional radical algorithm and show how to apply it to the
    present problem.",

  abstract =     "One of the most important applications of Buchberger's
                 algorithm for Gr{\"o}bner basis computation is the
                 solution of systems of polynomial equations (having
                 finitely many roots), i.e. the computation of zeros of
                 0-dimensional polynomial ideals. It is based on a
                 relation between Gr{\"o}bner bases w.r.t. a
                 lexicographical ordering and elimination ideals. The
                 algorithms discussed in this paper are implemented in
                 SCRATCHPAD II. In the first section the authors recall
                 some well-known properties of Gr{\"o}bner bases and
                 properties on the structure of Gr{\"o}bner bases of
                 zero-dimensional ideals; in the second section they
                 recall the Gr{\"o}bner basis algorithm for solving
                 systems of algebraic equations. The original results
                 are then presented. The authors first take advantage of
                 the obvious fact that density can be controlled
                 performing `small' changes of coordinates: they show
                 that such approach is possible during a Gr{\"o}bner
                 basis computation, in such a way that computations done
                 before a change of coordinates are valid also after it;
                 they propose a `linear algebra' approach to obtain the
                 Gr{\"o}bner basis w.r.t. the lexicographical ordering
                 from the one w.r.t. the total-degree ordering; and
                 finally they present a zero-dimensional radical
                 algorithm and show how to apply it to the present
                 problem.",

  abstract =
    "Born in Uruguay, Gonnet was first exposed to computers while working
    for IBM in Montevideo as a young man. This led him to a position at
    the university computer center, and in turn to an undergraduate degree
    in computer science in 1973. In 1974, following a military coup, he
    left for graduate studies in computer science at the University of
    Waterloo. Gonnet earned an M.Sc. and a Ph.D. in just two and a half
    years, writing a thesis on the analysis of search algorithms under the
    supervision of Alan George. After one year teaching in Rio de Janeiro
    he returned to Waterloo, as a faculty member.
    
    In 1980, Gonnet began work with a group including Morven Gentleman and
    Keith Geddes to produce an efficient interactive computer algebra
    system able to work well on smaller computers: Maple. Gonnet discusses
    in great detail the goals and organization of the Maple project, its
    technical characteristics, the Maple language and kernel, the Maple
    library, sources of funding, the contributions of the various team
    members, and the evolution of the system over time. He compares the
    resulting system to MACSYMA, Mathematica, Reduce, Scratchpad and other
    systems. Gonnet also examines the licensing and distribution of Maple
    and the project’s relations to its users. Maple was initially used for
    teaching purposes within the university, but soon found users in other
    institutions. From 1984, distribution was handled by Watcom, a company
    associated with the university, and 1988, Gonnet and Geddes created a
    new company, Waterloo Maple Software, Inc. to further commercialize
    Maple, which established itself as the leading commercial computer
    algebra system. However, during the mid-1990s the company ran into
    trouble and disagreements with his colleagues caused Gonnet to
    withdraw from managerial involvement. Since then, he feels that Maple
    has lost its battle with Mathematica. Gonnet also discusses Maple’s
    relation to Matlab and its creator, Cleve Moler.
    
    From 1984 onward with Frank Tompa, Tim Bray, and other Waterloo
    colleagues, Gonnet worked on the production of computer software to
    support the creation of the second edition of the Oxford English
    Dictionary. This led to the creation of another startup company, Open
    Text, producing software for the searching and indexing of textual
    information within large corporations. Gonnet explains his role in the
    firm, including his departure and his feeling that it made a strategic
    blunder by not exploiting its early lead in Internet search.
    
    Gonnet continued to work in a number of areas of computer science,
    including analysis of algorithms. In 1990, Gonnet moved from Waterloo
    to ETH in Switzerland. Among his projects since then have been Darwin,
    a bioinformatics system for the manipulation of genetic data, and
    leadership of the OpenMath project to produce a standard
    representation for mathematical objects. He has been involved in
    several further startup companies, including Aruna, a relational
    database company focused on business intelligence applications.",

    been developed with built in mechanisms for expressing abstract data types.
    These systems are object oriented in that they incorporate multiple

    "Let $S := k[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ be the polynomial ring in the
    variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ over the field $k$ and 
    $B := \{f_1,\ldots,f_m\} \subset S$
    be a finite system of polynomials. Denote by $I(B)$ the
    ideal generated by these polynomials. One of the major tasks of
    constructive commutative algebra is the derivation of information
    about the structure of 
    \[V(B):=\{a \in K^n : \forall f \in B{\rm\ such\ that\ }f(a)=0\}\]
    the set of common zeroes of the system $B$ over an
    algebraically closed extension $K$ of $k$.  Splitting the system into
    smaller ones, solving them separately, and patching all solutions
    together is often a good guess for a quick solution of even highly
    nontrivial problems. This can be done by several techniques, e.g.,
    characteristic sets, resultants, the Groebner factorizer or some ad
    hoc methods. Of course, such a strategy makes sense only for problems
    that really will split, i.e., for reducible varieties of
    solutions. Surprisingly often, problems coming from 11real life''
    fulfill this condition.  
    
    Among the methods to split polynomial systems into smaller pieces
    probably the Groebner factor- izer method attracted the most
    theoretical attention, see Czapor ([4, 5]), Davenport ([6]), Melenk, M
    ̈oller and Neun ([16, 17]) and Gr ̈abe ([13, 14]). General purpose
    Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) are well suited for such an approach,
    since they make available both a (more or less) well tuned
    implementation of the classical Groebner algorithm and an effective
    multivariate polynomial factorizer.
    
    Furthermore it turned out that the Groebner factorizer is not only a
    good heuristic approach for splitting, but its output is also usually
    a collection of almost prime components. Their description allows a
    much deeper understanding of the structure of the set of zeroes
    compared to the result of a sole Groebner basis computation.  
    
    Of course, for special purposes a general CAS as a multipurpose
    mathematical assistant can’t offer the same power as specialized
    software with efficiently implemented and well adapted algorithms and
    data types. For polynomial system solving, such specialized software
    has to implement two algorithmically complex tasks, solving and
    splitting, and until recently none of the specialized systems (as
    e.g., GB, Macaulay, Singular, CoCoA, etc.) did both
    efficiently. Meanwhile, being very efficient computing (classical)
    Groebner bases, development efforts are also directed, not only 
    for performance reasons, towards a better inclusion of factorization
    into such specialized systems.  Needless to remark that it needs some
    skill to force a special system to answer questions and the user will
    probably first try his ``home system'' for an answer. Thus the
    polynomial systems solving facility of the different CAS should behave
    especially well on such polynomial systems that are hard enough not to
    be done by hand, but not really hard to require special efforts. It
    should invoke a convenient interface to get the solutions in a form
    that is (correct and) well suited for further analysis in the familiar
    environment of the given CAS as the personal mathematical assistant.",

    This thesis presents an algorithm for computing (one-sided) limits
    within a symbolic manipulation system. Computing limtis is an
    important facility, as limits are used both by other functions such as
    the definite integrator and to get directly some qualitative
    information about a given function.

    The algorithm we present is very compact, easy to understand and easy
    to implement. It overcomes the cancellation problem other algorithms
    suffer from. These goals were achieved using a uniform method, namely
    by expanding the whole function into a series in terms of its most
    rapidly varying subexpression instead of a recursive bottom up
    expansion of the function. In the latter approach exact error terms
    have to be kept with each approximation in order to resolve the
    cancellation problem, and this may lead to an intermediate expression
    swell. Our algorithm avoids this problem and is thus suited to be
    implemented in a symbolic manipulation system.",

    by Keving Broughan, [BKRRD,BK]. For some years GK has had interests in
    (i) interactive front-ends to numeric computation, such as the
    NAG/IMSL library computation, and (ii) Fortran code generation for
    Argument SubPrograms (ASPs), such as those neede by some NAG/IMSL
    routines. Demonstrations of three links to the NAG library are
    described in [BKRRD]. A description of a link to NAG from Macsyma
    which was mentioned, but not in a sufficiently advanced state to
    demonstrate in early 1991, is given in [BK]. The situation at the end
    of 1991 was that there were links to NAG involving each of Macsyma,
    REDUCE and Mathematica. The links are called Naglink, IRENA and
    InterCall, respectively. The principal authors of IRENA are Mike Dewar
    and Mike Richardson. InterCall is not specific to the NAG library;
    indeed InterCall is used with calls to IMSL and to elsewhere at the
    conference venue, the University of New Mexico.
    
    The two futher links to NAG library treated in this paper are AXIOM2.0
    and genmex/ESC, genmex allows calls to NAG from Matlab. genmex can be
    regarded as similar to InterCall: genmes uses Matlab's mex files in a
    similar way to InterCall's use of Mathematica's MathLink. Again genmex
    is not specific to the NAG library. Mike Dewar is an author both of
    IRENA and the AXIOM2.0 link to the NAG library: see [D] foe discussion
    of the differences between the IRENA project and the AXIOM-NAG link

    "Sophus Lie (1842-1899) pioneered the study of continuous
    transformation groups that leave systems of differential equations
    invariant.  Lie’s work [l-3] brought diverse and ad hoc integration
    methods for solving special classes of differential equations under a
    common conceptual umbrella.  Indeed, Lie’s infinitesimal
    transformation method provides a widely applicable technique to find
    closed form solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODES).
    Standard solution methods for first-order or linear ODES can be
    characterized in terms of symmetries.  Through the group
    classification of ODES, Lie succeeded in identifying all ODES that can
    either be reduced to lower-order ones or be completely integrated via
    group theoretic techniques.  
    
    Applied to partial differential equations (PDEs), Lie’s method [2]
    leads to group-invariant solutions and conservation laws.  Exploiting
    the symmetries of PDEs, new solutions can be derived from known ones,
    and PDEs can be classified into equivalence classes.  Furthermore,
    group-invariant solutions obtained via Lie’s approach may provide
    insight into the physical models themselves, and explicit solutions
    can serve as benchmarks in the design, accuracy testing, and
    comparison of numerical algorithms.
    
    Nowadays, the concept of symmetry plays a key role in the study and
    development of mathematics and physics.  Indeed, the theory of Lie
    groups and Lie algebras is applied to diverse fields of mathematics
    including differential geometry, algebraic topology, bifurcation
    theory, to name a few.  Lie’s original ideas greatly influenced the
    study of physically important systems of differential equations in
    classical and quantum mechanics, fluid dynamics, elasticity, and many
    other applied areas [4-81].
    
    The application of Lie group methods to concrete physical systems
    involves tedious computations.  Even the calculation of the
    continuous symmetry group of a modest system of differential equations
    is prone to errors, if done with pencil and paper.  Computer algebra
    systems (CAS) such as Mathematica, MACSYMA, Maple, REDUCE, AXIOM and
    MuPAD are extremely useful for such computations.  Symbolic packages
    [9-11], written in the language of these GAS, can find the determining
    equations of the Lie symmetry group.  The most sophisticated packages
    then reduce these into an equivalent but more suitable system,
    subsequently solve that system in closed form, and go on to calculate
    the infinitesimal generators that span the Lie algebra of symmetries.
    
    In Section 2, we discuss methods and algorithms used in the
    computation of Lie symmetries.  We address the computation of
    determining systems, their reduction to standard form, solution
    techniques, and the computation of the size of the symmetry group.
    In Section 3, we look beyond Lie-point symmetries, addressing contact
    and generalized symmetries, as well as nonclassical or conditional
    symmetries.  
    
    Section 4 is devoted to a review of modern Lie symmetry
    programs, classified according to the underlying CAS.  The review
    focuses on Lie symmetry software for classical Lie-point symmetries,
    contact (or dynamical), generalized (or Lie-Backlund) symmetries,
    nonclassical (or conditional) symmetries.  Most of these packages were
    written in the last decade.  Researchers interested in details about
    pioneering work should consult [9,10,12].  In Section 5, two examples
    illustrate results that can be obtained with Lie symmetry software.
    In Section 6 we draw some conclusions.  
    
    Lack of space forces us to give only a few key references for the Lie
    symmetry packages.  A comprehensive survey of the literature devoted
    to theoretical as well as computational aspects of Lie symmetries,
    with over 300 references, can be found elsewhere [11].",

  abstract =
    "In computer algebra, the problem of computing topological invariants
    (i.e. delta-invariant, genus) of a plan complex algebraic curve is
    well-understood if the coefficients of the defining polynomial of the
    curve are exact data (i.e. integer numbers or rational numbers). The
    challenge is to handle this problem if the coefficients are inexact
    (i.e. numerical values).

    In this thesis, we approach the algebraic problem of computing
    invariants of a plane complex algebraic curve defined by a polynomial
    with both exact and inexact data. For the inexact data, we associate a
    positive real number called {\sl tolerance} or {\sl noise}, which
    measures the error level in the coefficients. We deal with an {\sl
    ill-posed} problem in the sense that, tiny changes in the input data
    lead to dramatic modifications in the output solution.

    For handling the ill-posedness of the problem we present a {\sl
    regularization} method, which estimates the invariants of a plane
    complex algebraic curve. Our regularization method consists of a set
    of {\sl symbolic-numeric algorithms} that extract structural
    information on the input curve, and of a {\sl parameter choice rule},
    i.e. a function in the noise level. We first design the following
    symbolic-numeric algorithms for computing the invariants of a plane
    complex algebraic curve:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item we compute the link of each singularity of the curve by numerical
    equation solving
    \item we compute the Alexander polynomial of each link by using
    algorithms from computational geometry (i.e. an adapted version of
    the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm) and combinatorial objects from knot
    theory.
    \item we derive a formula for the delta-invariant and for the genus
    \end{itemize}

    We then prove that the symbolic-numeric algorithms together with the
    parameter choice rule compute approximate solutions, which satisfy the
    {\sl convergence for noisy data property}. Moreover, we perform
    several numerical experiments, which support the validity for the
    convergence statement.

    We implement the designed symbolic-numeric algorithms in a new
    software package called {\sl Genom3ck}, developed using the {\sl Axel}
    free algebraic modeler and the {\sl Mathemagix} free computer algebra
    system. For our purpose, both of these systems provide modern
    graphical capabilities, and algebraic and geometric tools for
    manipulating algebraic curves and surfaces defined by polynomials with
    both exact and inexact data. Together with its main functionality to
    compute the genus, the package {\sl Genom3ck} computes also other type
    of information on a plane complex algebraic curve, such as the
    singularities of the curve in the projective plane and the topological
    type of each singularity.",

    "This paper is an abbreviated primer for the language of new
    SCRATCHPAD, a new implementation of SCRATCHPAD which has been under
    design and development by the Computer Algebra Group at the IBM
    Research Center during the past 6 years. The basic design goals of the
    new SCRATCHPAD language and interface to the user are to provde:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item a ``typeless'' interactive language suitable for on-line solution
    of mathematical problems by novice users with little or no programming
    required, and
    \item a programming language suitable for the formal description of
    algorithms and algebraic structures which can be compiled into run-time
    efficient object code.
    \end{itemize}
    
    The new SCRATCHPAD language is introduced by 11 keys with each
    successive key introducing an additional capability of the
    language. The language is thus described as a ``concentric'' language
    with each of the 11 levels corresponding to a language subset. These
    levels are more than just a pedagogic device, since they correspond to
    levels at which the system can be effectively used. Level 1 is
    sufficient for naive interactive use; levels 2-8 progressively
    introduce interactive users to capabilities of the language; levels
    9-11 are for system programmers and advanced users. Levesl 2, 4, 6,
    and 7 give users the full power of LISP with a high-level language;
    level 8 introduces ``type declarations;'' level 9 allows polymorphic
    functions to be defined and compiled; levels 10-11 give users an
    Ada-like facility for defining types and packages (those of new
    SCRATCHPAD are dynamically constructable, however). One language is
    used for both interactive and system programming language use,
    although several freedomes such as abbreviation and optional
    type-declarations allowed at top-level are not permitted in system
    code. The interactive language (levels 1-8) is a blend of original
    SCRATCHPAD [GRJY75], some proposed extensions [JENK74], work by Loos
    [LOOS74], SETL [DEWA79], SMP [COWO81], and new ideas; the system
    programming language (levels 1-11) superficially resembles Ada but is
    more similar to CLU [LISK74] in its semantic design.
    
    This presentation of the language in this paper omits many details to
    be covered in the SCRATCHPAD System Programming Manual [SCRA84] and an
    expanded version of this paper will serve as a primer for SCRATCHPAD
    users [JESU84].",

    "The Scratchpad II system represents a new generation of systems for
    doing symbolic mathematics, based on modern algebra and abstract data
    types. A large number of facilities are provided, for example:
    symbolic integration, ``infinite'' power series, differential operators,
    Cartesian tensors, and solution of nonlinear systems. Scratchpad II
    has been designed from the outset to be extendible. The system
    introduces a new data abstraction notion, the ``category,'' to express
    intricate interrelationships between data types. The result design
    permits the compilation of algorithms described in their most natural
    mathematical setting. The use of categories guarantees user defined
    types and packages are compatible with each other and with built in
    facilities. This system provides a single high‐level language with an
    intepreter and compiler. The language can be used by the naive user
    for convenient interactive mathematics calculations and by the
    advanced user for the efficient implementation of
    algorithms. Scratchpad II is built on Lisp/VM and runs on IBM/370
    class mainframes. An implementation of the system on the RT/PC is

    "Scratchpad [GrJe71] was a computer algebra system developed in the
    early 1970s.  Like M\&M (Maple [CGG91ab] and Mathematical [W01S92]) and
    other systems today, Scratchpad had one principal representation for
    mathematical formulae based on ``expression trees''.  Its user interface
    design was based on a pattern-matching paradigm with infinite rewrite-
    rule semantics, providing what we believe to be the most natural
    paradigm for interactive symbolic problem solving.  Like M\&M, however,
    user programs were interpreted, often resulting in poor performance
    relative to similar facilities coded in standard programming languages
    such as FORTRAN and C.  
    
    Scratchpad development stopped in 1976 giving way to a new system
    design ([JenR79], [JeTr81]) that evolved into AXIOM [JeSu92].
    AXIOM has a strongly-typed programming language for building a library
    of parameterized types and algorithms, and a type-inferencing
    interpreter that accesses the library and can build any of an infinite
    number of types for interactive use.
    
    We suggest that the addition of an expression tree type to AXIOM can
    allow users to operate with the same freedom and convenience of
    untyped systems without giving up the expressive power and run-time
    efficiency provided by the type system.  We also present a design that
    supports a multiplicity of programming styles, from the Scratchpad
    pattern-matching paradigm to functional programming to more
    conventional procedural programming.  The resulting design seems to us
    to combine the best features of Scratchpad with current AXIOM and to
    offer a most attractive, flexible, and user-friendly environment for
    interactive problem solving.
    
    Section 2 is a discussion of design issues contrasting AXIOM with
    other symbolic systems.  Sections 3 and 4 is an assessment of AXIOM’s
    current design for building libraries and interactive use.  Section 5
    describes a new interface design for AXIOM, its resulting paradigms,
    and its underlying semantic model.  Section 6 compares this work with
    others.",

    "The problem of efficiently evaluating special functions to high
    precision has been considered by numerous authors. Important tools
    used for this purpose include algorithms for evaluation of linearly
    recurrent sequences, and algorithms for power series arithmetic.

    In this work, we give new baby-step, giant-step algorithms for
    evaluation of linearly recurrent sequences involving an expensive
    parameter (such as a high-precision real number) and for computing
    compositional inverses of power series. Our algorithms do not have the
    best asymptotic complexity, but they are faster than previous
    algorithms in practice over a large input range.

    Using a combination of techniques, we also obtain efficient new
    algorithms for numerically evaluating the gamma function $\Gamma(z)$
    and the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,a)$, or Taylor series
    expansions of those functions, with rigorous error bounds. Our methods
    achieve softly optimal complexity when computing a large number of
    derivatives to proportionally high precision.

    Finally, we show that isolated values of the integer partition
    function $p(n)$ can be computed rigorously with softly optimal
    complexity by means of the Hardy-Ramanujan-Rademacher formula and
    careful numerical evaluation.

    We provide open source implementations which run significantly faster
    than previous published software. The implementations are used for
    record computations of the partition function, including the
    tabulation of several billion Ramanujan-type congruences, and of
    Taylor series associated with the Reimann zeta function.",

    readily derived via the classical geometry of stationary
    pseudospherical surfaces. Here, the motion of pseudospherical surfaces
    $S$ is considered in a natural orthonormal triad formulation. In one case,
    in a motion in which the Gaussian curvature of $S$ remains constant in
    time, an integrable nonlinear evolution equation is derived which has
    its origin in the description of wave propagation in an anharmonic
    crystal. In a second case, wherein the Gaussian curvature is allowed
    to vary in time, a classical generalised Weingarten system is derived
    in connection with the purely normal propagation of a pseudospherical
    surface. This is linked to triply orthogonal coordinate systems of
    Bianchi type. The generalised Weingarten system incorporates an

    "CAS/$\pi$ is a Computer Algebra System graphic user interface
    designed to be highly portable and extensible. It has been developed
    by composition of pre-existing software tools such as Maple, Sisyphe,
    or Ulysse systems, ZicVis 3-D plotting library, etc, using control
    integration technology and a set of high level graphic toolkits to
    build the formula editor and the dialog manager. The main aim of
    CAS/$\pi$ is to allow a wide range of runtime recon gurations and
    extensions. For instance, it is possible to add new tools to a running
    system, to modify connections between working tools, to extend the set
    of graphic symbols managed by the formula editor, to design new high
    level editing commands based on the syntax or semantics of
    mathematical formulas, to customize and extend the menu-button based
    user interface, etc. More generally, CAS/$\pi$ can be seen equally as
    a powerful system-independent graphic user interface enabling
    inter-systems communications, a toolkit to allow fast development of
    custom-made scientific software environments, or a very convenient
    framework for experimenting with computer algebra systems protocols
    and man-machine interfaces.",

    it is possible to describe algorithms abstractly, thus emphasizing

    "Mechanized reasoning systems and computer algebra systems have
    different objectives. Their integration is highly desirable, since
    formal proofs often involve both of the two different tasks proving
    and calculating. Even more important, proof and computation are often
    interwoven and not easily separable.

    In this article, we advocate an integration of computer algebra into
    mechanized reasoning systems at the proof plan level. This approach
    allows us to view the computer algebra algorithms as methods, that is,
    declarative representations of the problem-solving knowledge specific
    to a certain mathematical domain. Automation can be achieved in many
    cases by searching for a hierarchic proof plan at the method level by
    using suitable domain-specific control knowledge about the
    mathematical algorithms. In other words, the uniform framework of
    proof planning allows us to solve a large class of problems that are
    not automatically solvable by separate systems.

    Our approach also gives an answer to the correctness problems inherent
    in such an integration. We advocate an approach where the computer
    algebra system produces high-level protocol information that can be
    processed by an interface to derive proof plans. Such a proof plan in
    turn can be expanded to proofs at different levels of abstraction, so
    the approach is well suited for producing a high-level verbalized
    explication as well as for a low-level, machine-checkable,
    calculus-level proof. We present an implementation of our ideas and
    exemplify them using an automatically solved example.",

    "Orthogonal polynomials have a long history, and are still important
    objects of consideration in mathematical research as well as in
    applications in Mathematical Physics, Chemistry, and
    Engineering. Quite a lot is known about them. Particularly well-known
    are differential equations, recurrence equations, Rodrigues formulas,
    generating functions and hypergeometric representations for the
    classical systems of Jacobi, Laguerre and Hermite which can be found
    in mathematical dictionaries. Less well-known are the corresponding
    representations for the classical discrete systems of Hahn,
    Krawtchouk, Meixner and Charlier, as well as addition theorems,
    connection relations between different systems and other identities
    for these and other systems of orthogonal polynomials. The ongoing
    research in this still very active subject of mathematics expands the
    knowledge database about orthogonal polynomials continuously. In the
    last few decades the classical families have been extended to a rather
    large collection of polynomial systems, the so-called Askey-Wilson
    scheme, and they have been generalized in other ways as well.

    Recently new algorithmic approaches have been discovered to compute
    differential, recurrence and similar equations from series or integral
    representations. These methods turn out to be quite useful to prove or
    detect identities for orthogonal polynomial systems. Further
    algorithms to detect connection coefficients or to identify polynomial
    systems from given recurrence equations have been developed. Although
    some algorithmic methods had been known already in the last century,
    their use was rather limited due to the immense amount of
    calculations. Only the existence and distribution of computer algebra
    systems makes their use simple and useful for everybody.

    In this plenary lecture an overview is given of how algorithmic
    methods implemented in computer algebra systems can be used to prove
    identities about and to detect new knowledge for orthogonal
    polynomials and other hypergeometric type special functions.
    Implementations for this type of algorithms exist in Maple,
    Mathematica and REDUCE, and maybe also in other computer algebra
    systems. Online demonstrations will be given using Maple V.5.",

    computer algebra in an area not usually associated with that

    generalizes several other approaches, [GL], [GLS1], [GLS2], [BL], [BL2].  
    
    This is an expository note which is intended to help make homological
    perturbation theory more accesible and to encourage wider use of
    Computer Algebra in mathematical research.
    
    The class of objects presented here -- Finitely generated torsion-free
    nilpotent groups (of arbitrary nilpotency class) -- are given because
    of their simplicity. The examples point to the general phenomena that
    are to be expected when trying to derive complexes smaller than
    ``standard complexes'' in other homological contexts. The complexes
    produced are generally {\sl much} smaller than the bar construction, but
    larger than a {\sl minimal resolution}.",

    "The quantum Yang-Baxter equation (QYBE) has roots in statistical
    mechanics and the inverse scattering method and leads to a natural
    construction of a bialgebra. It turns out to have important
    connections with knot theory and invariants of 3-manifolds. There are
    now available many reference books to quantum groups and these various
    applications. The book under review develops the algebraic
    underpinning and theory of the QYBE, including the constant form and
    the one and two parameter forms.
    
    We give a brief description of the chapters. Chapter 1 (together with
    an Appendix) gives the algebraic preliminaries involving coalgebras,
    bialgebras, Hopf algebras, modules and comodules. Chapter 2 introduces
    the various forms of the QYBE, and the basic algebraic structures
    associated to them, including Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtadzhan (FRT)
    construction. Chapter 3 explores various categorical settings for the
    constant form of the QYBE, the most basic being the category of left
    QYB modules over a bialgebra and the notion of algebras, coalgebras,
    etc. in this category. Chapter 4 develops universal mapping properties
    of the FRT construction and its reduced version, and the authors
    investigate when the reduced FRT construction leads to a pointed
    bialgebra or a pointed Hopf algebra. Chapter 5 develops the quantum
    groups associated to $SL(2)$, i.e., the quantum universal enveloping
    algebra, and the quantum function algebra. Chapter 6 introduces
    quasitriangular Hopf algebras, and discusses how the
    finite-dimensional ones give rise to solutions of the QYBE through
    their representation theory. The most important example is the
    Drinfeld double of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. The authors note
    (through an exercise!) that every finite-dimensional Hopf algebra is
    the reduced FRT construction of some solution to the QYBE. Chapter 7
    introduces coquasitriangular bialgebras, the most important being the
    FRT and the reduced FRT constructions. There are some generalizations
    here to the one-parameter form of the QYBE. Chapter 8 uses all the
    previously developed techniques to find solutions of the QYBE in
    certain cases, including the one-parameter form. Some of these were
    discovered by computer algebra methods. The final chapter 9 gives a
    brief discussion of certain categorical constructions and the QYBE is
    certain fairly abstract categories, motivated by the fact that the FRT
    construction is a coend.
    
    This book fills an important niche in the literature involving the
    QYBE by highlighting the algebraic aspects and applications. Although
    this is basically a reference book, it includes so many important
    parts of the study of Hopf algebras that it could be used as a
    textbook for a certain type of course on Hopf algebras and quantum
    groups, and certainly as supplementary reading material for such a
    course. There are frequent exercises which would be useful for such
    purposes. Besides being a basic source book, the authors include some
    new results and some novel approaches to earlier results. All this
    makes this book a most welcome addition to the quantum group
    literature.",

    "The algebraic programming system (APS) developed at the
    V. M. Glushkov Institute of Cybernetics of the Academy of Sciences of
    the Ukrainian SSR integrates the basic programming paradigms,
    including procedural, functional, algebraic, and logic programming.
    
    Algebraic programming in APS relies on special data structures, the
    so-called graph terms, which permit using diverse data and knowledge
    representations in relevant application domains. In the language
    APLAN, graph terms are described by expressions or systems of
    expressions of a many-sorted algebra of data. They may represent both
    objects of the application domain and reasoning about these
    objects. The option of setting an arbitrary interpretation of the
    operations in the algebra of data makes it possible to use APS as a
    basis for various extensions.
    
    Symbolic computation systems such as Scratchpad/AXIOM have acquired
    special importance. They provide various possibilities of manipulating
    typed mathematical objects, including objects of complex hierarchical
    structure. This is a natural requirement when working with algebraic
    objects. In particular, the properties of many algebraic structures
    (such as groups, rings, fields, etc.) are naturally
    hierarchical-modular.
    
    The Institute of Cybernetics and the Kherson Teachers’ College have
    developed an instruction-oriented computer algebra system AIST. The
    AIST kernel is a hierarchical structure of mathematical concepts
    described in the APS language. However, construction of new
    applications on the basis of this hierarchical structure has proved

    one of the possible ways of introducing types in APS. The

    "Exact symbolic computation with polynomials and matrices over
    polynomial rings has wide applicability to many fields [Hereman96,
    Lewis99]. By ``exact symbolic'', we mean computation with polynomials
    whose coefficients are integers (of any size), rational numbers, or
    from finite fields, as opposed to coefficients that are ``floats'' of a
    certain precision. Such computation is part of most computer algebra
    (CA) systems. Over the last dozen years, several large CA systems have
    become widely available, such as Axiom, Derive, Macsyma, Maple,
    Mathematica and Reduce. They tend to have great breadth, be produced
    by profit-making companies, and be relatively expensive, at least for
    a full blown non-student version. However, most if not all of these
    systems have difficulty computing with the polynomials and matrices
    that arise in actual research. Real problems tend to produce large
    polynomials and large matrices that the general CA systems cannot
    handle [Lewis99].
    
    In the last few years, several smaller CA systems focused on
    polynomials have been produced at universities by individual
    researchers or small teams. They run on Macs, PCs and workstations.
    They are freeware or shareware. Several claim to be much more
    efficient than the large systems at exact polynomial computations. The
    list of these systems includes CoCoA, Fermat, MuPAD, Pari-Gp and
    Singular [CoCoA, Fermat, MuPAD, Pari-Gp, Singular].
    
    In this paper, we compare these small systems to each other and to two
    of the large systems (Magma and Maple) on a set of problems involving
    exact symbolic computation with polynomials and matrices. The problems
    here involve:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item the ground rings $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{Z}/p$ 
    and other finite fields
    \item basic arithmetic of polynomials over the ground ring
    \tem basic arithmetic of rational functions over the ground ring
    \item polynomial evaluation (substitution)
    \item matrix normal form
    \item determinants and characteristic polynomial
    \item GCDs of multivariate polynomial
    \item resultants

    "The Heuristic Polynomial GCD procedure (GCDHEU) is used by the Maple
    computer algebra system, but not other. Because Maple has an
    especially efficient kernel that provides fast integer arithmetic, but
    a relatively slower interpreter for non-kernel code, the GCDHEU
    routine is especially effective in that it moves much of the
    computation into ``bignum'' arithmetic and hence executes primarily in
    the kernel.
    
    We speculated that in other computer algebra systems an implementation
    GCDHEU would not be advantageous. In particular, if {\sl all} the
    system code is compiled to run at ``full speed'' in a (presumably more
    bulky) kernel that is entirely written in C or compiled Lisp, then
    there would seem to be no point in recasting the polynomial gcd
    problem into a bignum GCD problem. Manipulating polynomials that are
    vectors of coefficients would seem to be equivalent computationally to
    manipulating vectors of big digits.
    
    Yet our evidence suggests that one can take advantage of the GCDHEU in
    a Lisp system as well. Given a good implementation of bignums, for
    most small problems and many large ones, a substantial speedup can be
    obtained by the appropriate choice of GCD algorithm, including often
    enought, the GCDHEU approach. Another major winner seem to be the
    subresultant polynomial remainder sequence algorithm. Because more
    sophisticated sparse algorithms are relatively slow on small problems
    and only occasionally emerge as superior (on larger problems) it seems
    the choice of a fast GCD algorithm is tricky.",

    By using adapted data structures, asymptotically fast algorithms and

    We chose AXIOM and ALDOR as our implementation and experimentation

    system solvers based on symbolic computation. Solving systems of
    non-linear, algebraic or differential equations, is a fundamental
    problem in mathematical sciences. It has been studied for centuries
    and still stimulates many research developments, in particular on the
    front of high-performance computing.

    Triangular decompositions are a highly promising technique with the
    potential to produce high-performance polynomial system solvers. This
    thesis makes several contributions to this effort.

    We propose asymptotically fast algorithms for the core operati ons on
    which triangular decompositions rely. Complexity results and comparati
    ve implementation show that these new algorithms provide substantial
    performance improvements.

    We present a fundamental software library for polynomial arithmetic in
    order to support the implementation of high-performance solvers based
    on triangular decompositions. We investigate strategies for the
    integration of this library in high-level programming environments
    where triangular decompositions are usually implemented.

    We obtain a high performance library combining highly optimized C
    routines and solving procedures written in the Maple computer algebra
    system. The experimental result shows that our approaches are very

    "The ultimate objective of this paper is to create a stepping stone to
    the development of new quantum algorithms. The strategy chosen is to
    begin by focusing on the class of abelian quantum hidden subgroup
    algorithms, i.e., the class of abelian algorithms of the Shor/Simon
    genre. Our strategy is to make this class of algorithms as
    mathematically transparent as possible. By the phrase ``mathematically
    transparent'' we mean to expose, to bring to the surface, and to make
    explicit the concealed mathematical structures that are inherently and
    fundamentally a part of such algorithms. In so doing, we create
    symbolic abelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms that are analogous
    to the those symbolic algorithms found within such software packages
    as Axiom, Cayley, Maple, Mathematica, and Magma.

    As a spin-off of this effort, we create three different
    generalizations of Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm to free abelian
    groups of finite rank. We refer to these algorithms as wandering (or
    vintage $\mathbb{Z}_Q$) Shor algorithms. They are essentially quantum
    algorithms on free abelian groups of finite rank $n$ which, with each
    iteration, first select a random cyclic direct summand $\mathbb{Z}$ of
    the group and then apply one iteration of the standard Shor algorithm
    to produce a random character of the “approximating” finite group
    $\widetilde{A} = \mathbb{Z}_Q$, called the group probe. These
    characters are then in turn used to find either the order $P$ of a
    maximal cyclic subgroup $\mathbb{Z}_P$ of the hidden quotient group
    $H_{\varphi}$, or the entire hidden quotient group $H_{\varphi}$. An
    integral part of these wandering quantum algorithms is the selection
    of a very special random transversal $t_{\mu}:\widetilde{A}\rightarrow A$,
    which we refer to as a Shor transversal. The algorithmic time
    complexity of the first of these wandering Shor algorithms is found to
    be $O(n^2({rm lg\ } Q)^3 ({\rm lg\ }{\rm lg\ } Q)^{n+1})$.",

    "The term ``Picard iteration'' occurs two places in undergraduate
    mathematics. In numerical analysis it is used when discussing fixed
    point iteration for finding a numerical approximation to the equation
    $s=g(x)$. In differential equations, Picard iteration is a
    constructive procedure for establishing the existence of a solution to
    a differential equation $y^{\prime} = f(x,y)$.
    
    The first type of Picard iteration uses computations to generate a
    sequence of numbers which converges to a solution. We will not present
    this application, but mention that it involves the traditional role of
    the computer as a ``number cruncher.''
    
    The second application of Picard iteration illustrates how to use a
    computer to generate a sequence of functions which converges to a
    solution. The purpose of this article is to show the step by step
    process in translating mathematical theory into the symbolic
    manipulation setting. Systems such as MACSYM, ALTRAN, REDUCE, SMP,
    MAPLE, SCRATCHPAD and muMATH are being introduced in undergraduate
    mathematics courses to assist in keeping trace of equations during

    This paper investigates some soundness conditions which have to be

    Reynolds on unrestricted generic operators is extended to generic
    operators which obey certain constraints. We get natural conditions
    for such operators, which are expressed within the theoretic framework
    of category theory. However, in the context of computer algebra, there
    arise examples of coercions and generic operators which do not fulfil
    these conditions. We describe a framework -- relaxing the above
    conditions -- that allows distinguishing between cases of ambiguities
    which can be resolved in a quite natural sense and those which
    cannot. An algorithm is presented that detects such unresolvable

    "In 1980 Schwartz gave a fast {\sl probabilistic} method which tests
    if a matrix of polynomials of $\mathbb{Z}$ is singular or not. The

    mappings of mathematical expressions into finite rings. In Schwartz's
    paper, they were polynomials over $\mathbb{Z}$ into GF($p$). Because
    computation in GF($p$) is very fast compared with computing with
    polynomials, Schwartz's method yields an enormous speedup both in
    theory and in practice. Therefore it is desirable to extend the class
    of expressions for which we can find effective signature functions. In
    the mid 80's Gonnet extended the class of expressions, for which
    signature functions can be found, to include a restricted class of
    elementary functions and integer roots. In this paper we present and

    poor performance on large sparse polynomials.

    In this paper we use an auxiliary heap of pointers to reduce the
    number of monomial comparisons in the worst case while keeping the
    overall storage linear. We give two variations. In the first, the size
    of the heap is bounded by the number of terms in the quotient(s). In
    the second, which is new, the size is bounded by the number of terms
    in the divisor(s).

    We use dynamic arrays of terms rather than linked lists to reduce
    storage allocations and indirect memory references. We pack monomials
    in the array to reduce storage and to speed up monomial
    comparisons. We give a new packing for the graded reverse
    lexicographical ordering.

    We have implemented the heap algorithms in C with an interface to
    Maple. For comparison we have also implemented Yan’s ``geobuckets'' data

    an effective and natural way. Since the computational models of Maple
    and Aldor differ significantly, new run-time code must implement a
    non-trivial semantic correspondence. Our solution allows Aldor
    functions to run tightly coupled to the Maple environment, able to
    directly and efficiently manipulate Maple data objects. We call the
    overall system Alma.",

    where $f_i$ is (for $i=1,\ldots,m$) a polynomial in $2n$ variables
    $(X,P)=(X_1,\ldots,X_n,P_1,\ldots,P_n)$. This covers in particular
    quasilinear systems, often encountered in applications and defined

    is at most one. The approach is close to the geometrical framework
    of Rabier and Rheinboldt, profitting from the polynomial form of
    the system.

    The authors develop an algorithm for the symbolic computation of
    the set of consistent initial values via ideal-theoretic results;

    together with the notions of the completion of a given ideal and the

    sub-resultant-like algorithms instead of Euclidean-like algorithms.
    We use these algorithms to compute polynomial gcds and Bezout
    relations, to compute the roots and the signs of algebraic
    numbers. This allows us to work in the ring of real algebraic integers
    instead of the field of read algebraic numbers avoiding many

    "Both Computer Algebra Systems (CASs) and dynamic geometry systems
    (DGSs) have reached a high level of development. Some CASs (like Maple
    or Derive) include specific and powerful packages devoted to Euclidean
    geometry, but CASs have incorporated neither mouse drawing
    capabilities nor dynamic capabilities. Meanwhile, the well-known DGSs
    do not provide algebraic facilities.

    Maple’s and Derive’s paramGeo packages and the DGS-CAS translator (all
    freely available from the authors) make it possible to draw a
    geometric configuration with the mouse (using The Geometer’s Sketchpad
    3 or 4) and to obtain the coordinates, equations, etc., of the drawn
    configuration in Maple’s or Derive’s syntax. To obtain complicated
    formulae, coordinates of points or equations of loci, to perform
    automatic theorem proving and to perform automatic discovery directly
    from sketches are examples of straightforward applications. Moreover,
    this strategy could be adapted to other CASs and DGSs.

    This work clearly has a didactic application in geometric problems
    exploration. Nevertheless, its main interest is to provide a
    convenient time-saving way to introduce data when dealing with rule
    and compass geometry, which has a wider scope than only educational
    purposes.",

    If I were demonstrating Axiom and were asked this question, my reply

    would illustrate this with the following example.

    Consider the following system of O.D.E.'s
    \[
    \begin{array}{rcl}
    \frac{dx_1}{dt} & = & \left(1+\frac{cos t}{2+sin t}\right)x_1\\

    defining subtyping among algebraic domains. The inheritance at
    category level has been formalized; this allows the automatic
    inference of type classes. By means of type classes and existential
    types we construct subtype relations without involving coercions. A
    type sharing mechanism works in parallel and allows the consistent
    extension and combination of domains. The expressiveness of the system
    is further increased by viewing domain types as special case of
    package types, forming weak and strong sums respectively. The
    introduced system, although awkward at first sight, is simpler than
    other proposed systems for computer algebra without including some of
    their problems. The system can be further extended in other to support
    more constructs and increase its flexibility.",

    An introduction to the formal theory of partial differential equations
    is given emphasizing the properties of involutive symbols and
    equations.  An algorithm to complete any differential equation to an
    involutive one is presented. For an involutive equation possible
    values for the number of arbitrary functions in its general solution
    are determined. The existence and uniqueness of solutions for analytic
    equations is proven.  Applications of these results include an
    analysis of symmetry and reduction methods and a study of gauge
    systems. It is show that the Dirac algorithm for systems with
    constraints is closely related to the completion of the equation of
    motion to an involutive equation. Specific examples treated comprise
    the Yang-Mills Equations, Einstein Equations, complete and Jacobian
    systems, and some special models in two and three dimensions. To
    facilitate the involved tedious computations an environment for
    geometric approaches to differential equations has been developed in

    "In this article, a brief exposition of a method for finding first
    integrals for first order multinomial autonomous systems (FOMAS) of
    ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients will be
    given. The method is a simplified as well as a redesigned version
    based on a paper of Goldman (1987). We shall see how it can be applied
    to FOMAS with parametric coefficients. The algorithm is currently
    being implemented by the author, using the SCRATCHPAD II computer
    algebra language and system at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center.
    
    FOMAS occur and are of interest in many disciplines and their first
    integrals (or trajectories of motion) are generally difficult to
    find. Examples of FOMAS are too numerous to list, some well-known ones
    are the Riccati equation, the Lotka-Volterra equations for competing
    populations, Selkov's model for chemical reactions, the Lorenz system
    of the Rayleigh-Bernard problem, and Hamiltonian systems (where the
    Hamiltonian is a sum of monomial terms with constant coefficients).
    
    Let $Y=(y_1,\ldots,y_n)$ be $n$ functions depending on the variable
    $\tau$. A monomial in $Y$ is a product of the form $y_1^{k_1}\cdots
    y_n^{k_n}$, where $k_1,\ldots,k_n$ are constants. If
    $K=(k_1,\ldots,k_n)$, we shall denote the monomial in $Y$ by $Y^K$,
    and $K$ is called the exponent vector for the monomial. By convention,
    exponent vectors are column vectors, but whenever convenient, we shall
    write exponent vectors as row vectors. We say that $Y$ satisfies a
    first-order multinomial autonomous system (FOMAS) if for each $i$, $1
    \le i \le n$, $y_i$ satisfies a first order differential equation of
    the form:
    \[y_i^{\prime} = f_i(Y)\quad\quad\quad(1)\]
    where $f_i$ is a linear combination of monomials in $Y$ with coefficients
    which may be either constants or parametric constants. For example, the
    Lotka-Volterra equations for three competing species considered by
    Schwarz and Steeb (1984), form a FOMAS:
    \[x_1^{\prime}=x_1(1+ax_2+bx_3)\]
    \[x_2^{\prime}=x_2(1-ax_1+bx_3)\]
    \[x_3^{\prime}=x_3(1-bx_1-cx_2)\]
    When the exponent vectors occuring in $f_i$ are all non-negative integers,
    as in the example above, a FOMAS reduces to a polynomial autonomous
    system (FOPAS).
    
    A computer program was developed by Schwarz (1986) to compute the
    first integrals of FOPAS's which are themselves polynomials in
    $y_1,\ldots,y_n$. Schwarz's algorithm literally takes a general
    polynomial of a fixed degree $d$ in $n$ variables and substitutes it
    into (1). This method does not work well on a FOMAS, because in a
    FOMAS, the exponent vectors need not have integral components. Also,
    it wll not find integrals with exponent vectors that involve
    fractional or irrational numbers.
    
    Goldman (1987) proved a theorem which gives necessary and sufficient
    conditions for the existence of a multinomial first integral for
    FOMAS. The proof also contained the outline of an algorithm for
    finding such integrals. In Goldman's paper, he introduced the notion
    of an integral array, which is a certain matrix satisfying some 10
    conditions. He gave a few hints and several examples but did not
    elaborate on how such an integral array can be found in general
    (except in the case $q=2$). Assuming such an array is found, he can
    compute the integral, in most cases, by solving systems of linear
    equations, or at worse in certain cases, by solving a system of
    algebraic equations. It was not clear when algebraic conditions are
    necessary.
    
    In this brief exposition, Goldman's method will be expanded to a
    complete algorithm with a new simplified notation. The integral arrays
    are replaced by addition schemes (which is equivalent to integral
    arrays with some conditions removed). The generation of addition
    schemes is a combinatorial problem unrelated, in a sense, to
    FOMAS. When the first integral is a polynomial, the additioin scheme
    is trivial to compute. We shall now begin by explaining some details
    of this theory.",

    "The introduction of first-class type classes in the Coq system calls
    for a re-examination of the basic interfaces used for mathematical
    formalisation in type theory. We present a new set of type classes for
    mathematics and take full advantage of their unique features to make
    practical a particularly flexible approach that was formerly thought
    to be infeasible. Thus, we address traditional proof engineering
    challenges as well as new ones resulting from our ambition to build
    upon this development a library of constructive analysis in which any
    abstraction penalties inhibiting efficient computation are reduced to
    a minimum.

    The basis of our development consists of type classes representing a
    standard algebraic hierarchy, as well as portions of category theory
    and universal algebra. On this foundation, we build a set of
    mathematically sound abstract interfaces for different kinds of
    numbers, succinctly expressed using categorical language and universal
    algebra constructions.

    Strategic use of type classes lets us support these high-level
    theory-friendly definitions, while still enabling efficient
    implementations unhindered by gratuitous indirection, conversion or
    projection.

    Algebra thrives on the interplay between syntax and semantics. The
    Prolog-like abilities of type class instance resolution allow us to
    conveniently define a quote function, thus facilitating the use of

  abstract = 
    "Based on our experiences with IRENA, we decided to use generic
    inter-process communication tools for the link to AXIOM. This has the
    added advantage that we can operate across a network. The main
    technique we use is the {\sl Remote Procedure Call} (RPC) [Sun
    Microsystems Inc., 1988] which allows us to interact with a server on
    another machine (or on the local machine). RPC takes care of
    differences in data representation (e.g. the byte-order of floating
    point numbers) on different architectures.
    
    AXIOM is a multi-process package. Normally when a user starts up the
    system they start up the various components which then interact via
    standard socket operations. If they are using the line, they start up
    a new process: the NAG Manager (NAGMAN for short). Additionally, there
    will be a NAG daemon (NAGD) running on any machine on which the user
    may wish to execute NAG routines (which could include the local
    host). NAGMAN commnicates with the running AXIOM system via a socket
    down which is transmitted the details of and data for the particular
    routine to be called. NAGMAN calls a NAGD on another machine via RPC
    and eventually returns the results to AXIOM.
    
    NAGD consists of the server program, and a set of stub codes designed
    to call individual NAG routines. It is, in effect, a remotely-callable
    version of the NAG library. There is no reason why AXIOM should be the
    only system to use it, and indeed there are plans to incorporate the
    ability to call NAGD into other systems.
    
    An ASP is treated just like any other piece of data by the AXIOM-NAG
    link. The source code is passed to NAGD and compiled. (There are
    various optimisations to prevent the same code being compiled multiple
    times, but the details needn't concern us here.) This compiled code is
    linked with the NAG Library to make the executable. Thus if a user
    calls the same NAG routine with different ASPs the routine will be
    relinked each time.
    
    It would be nice if this were not necessary. The authors of the link
    considered two other possibilities:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Have AXIOM simulate the ASPs, so that the NAG Library would call
    back to AXIOM when it wanted to call an ASP. This was rejected as
    being far too slow across a network.
    \item Give NAGD the ability to interpret AXIOM or Fortran code. Thus
    the NAG routine would call a function which would evaluate a
    representation of an ASP to get the required values. This may happen
    in the future if data interchange mechanisms between systems are
    stanardised, but was rejected for the time being since such a system
    would have to be tailored to match each Fortran compiler that NAGD used.
    \end{itemize}
    
    By transmitting source code for ASPs we allow the remote Fortran
    compiler to take care of low-level portability problems.
    
    Both IRENA and the AXIOM-NAG Link make using the NAG Library easier in
    a functional kind of way. They present a more natural, interactive
    interface and, what is more, they cut out some of the tedium of
    writing code by generating values for some parameters (array
    dimensions etc.) and computing derivatives and
    jacobians. Unfortunately the user still has to choose which algorithm
    to use, and tuen the control parameters to give a result of the
    required accuracy.
    
    This is not a trivial task. The NAG Library has some thirty quadrature
    routines, and maby forty top-level ODE-solving routines. The criteria
    for selecting a routine can include features of the problem such as
    whether a function is continuous, or they can include requrements from
    the user such as whether speed or accuracy is important. The user
    should also think carefully about whether the problem is being
    presentin in the best way: perhaps an integral can be solved more
    easily if the range of integration is split into several pieces for
    example.
    
    Many users of numerical software would like to be presented with a
    ``black box'' for solving a given class of problems. In practice many
    users will always try solving a problem with the ``simplest'' method
    first, in the hope that they can escape having to think seriously
    about their problem! This is not always a bad idea anyway, since the
    feedback from the routine can help determine a better technique
    (e.g. by identifying the regions where problems occur).
    
    We contend that computer algebra has an important role to play in this
    area. The ability of algebra systems to analyse the symbolic features
    of a problem make them idea {\sl agents} for knowledge-based (or
    expert) systems to use in selecting routines. Their ability (via IRENA
    or AXIOM-NAG) to drive the numerical codes is a bonus.
    
    Writing such packages is not easy. Some problem attributes are easy to
    determin (e.g {\sl is a matrix symmetric?} or {\sl is a region
    finite?}), but some are very hard and may in fact be in general
    undecidable without human intervention. Even if a tecnique exists to
    determine a particular attribute it may be too slow to use in
    practice. Then, once we have these pieces of information, we need a
    mechanism to allow us to reason with them effectively."

    cap. If $K$ is invariant under a cyclic subgroup (which acts regularly
    on $K$) of $PGL(n+1,q)$, the $K$ is cyclic.

    This article investigates cyclic complete $k$-caps in
    $PG(3,q). Namely, the different types of complete $k$-caps $K$ in
    $PG(3,q)$ stabilized by a cyclic projective group $G$ of order $k$,
    acting regularly on the points of $K$, are determined. We show that in
    $PG(3,q)$, $q$ even, the elliptic quadric is the only cyclic complete
    $k$-cap. For $q$ odd, it is shown that besides the elliptic quadric,
    there also exist cyclic $k$-caps containing $k/2$ points of two
    disjoint elliptic quadrics or two disjoint hyperbolic quadrics and
    that there exist cyclic $k$-caps stabilized by a transitive cyclic
    group $G$ fixed precisely one point and one plane of
    $PG(3,q)$. Concrete examples of such caps, found using AXIOM and

    (1994; Zbl 0819.26003)] have greatly faciliated mathematical
    experiments and have thus become popular tools for the modern
    mathematician. It is a pity that most of these packages are quite
    expensive, and that the frequently upgraded versions are not free for
    the owners of the earlier versions (fortunately, there are inexpensive
    student versions of some of these packages). There is a constant
    demand of instructional textbooks by users of these packages. This
    demand is reflected in the growing number of such textbooks. Many of
    these books provide software support (diskette, CD-ROM, access by
    ftp). Such a textbook should meet, in my opinion, the following
    criteria: (1) The size should be small, not bulky like the complete
    technical descriptions of the software. (2) There should be a lot of
    examples of the use of the software covering a wide range of
    mathematical topics. Electronic versions of these examples should be
    made available for free to the users of the textbook
    (e.g. diskette/CD-ROM, access by ftp). (3) There should be a good
    supply of exercises covering the basic mathematical applications. (4)
    The book should be visually pleasing, easy to read, have good indexes
    and provide pointers to other books and electronic sources of
    information. The book under review provides, in addition to the actual
    text, an interactive exploratorium of its topics, based on the
    mechanism of Maple worksheets. These worksheets can be ``opened'' by
    the Maple program and they form a mixture of usual text, hypertext,
    and Maple commands and have a nice style appearance. They also can be
    ``exported'' in a file and included in a file for further treatment.
    The book meets all the aforementioned criteria (1)-(4) with elegance.
    There are many exercises which cover all the usual mathematical topics
    from linear algebra to differential equations and statistics. A
    valuable feature is an appendix with hints and answers for all
    exercises.  One of the highlights of the book is the examination of
    Riemann's non-differentiable function
    \[x \mapsto \sum_{k=1}^\infty{k^{-2}} sin(\pi kx)\]
    which is differentiable only at the rational points $p/q$ with $p$
    and $q$ odd and relatively prime, where its derivative is $-1/2$.

    The book is intended for students of mathematics, engineering
    sciences, and econometry. This book is an ideal guide for this purpose
    and it could probably be used along, without the bulky technical
    documentation of the Maple language. Note that Maple has a
    comprehensive on-line help program, which contains large parts of the
    original documentation.",

    Algorithms for computing integral bases of an algebraic function field

    integers in an algebraic number field, to the case of a function field.

    It turns out that using algebraic geometry one can write a faster
    algorithm. The method we will give is based on Puiseux expansions.
    One cas see this as a variant on the Coates' algorithm as it is
    described in [Davenport, 1981]. Some difficulties in computing with
    Puiseux expansions can be avoided using a sharp bound for the number
    of terms required which will be given in Section 3. In Section 5 we

    furnishes a complete zero decomposition of the given polynomial

    "The development of polynomial-elimination techniques from classical
    theory to modern algorithms has undergone a tortuous and rugged
    path. This can be observed L. van der Waerden's elimination of the
    ``elimination theory'' chapter from from B. his classic Modern Algebra
    in later editions, A. Weil's hope to eliminate ``from algebraic
    geometry the last traces of elimination theory,'' and S. Abhyankar's
    suggestion to ``eliminate the eliminators of elimination theory.''
    The renaissance and recognition of polynomial elimination owe much to
    the advent and advance of modern computing technology, based on
    which effective algorithms are implemented and applied to diverse
    problems in science and engineering. In the last decade, both
    theorists and practitioners have more and more realized the
    significance and power of elimination methods and their underlying
    theories. Active and extensive research has contributed a great deal
    of new developments on algorithms and soft­ ware tools to the subject,
    that have been widely acknowledged. Their applications have taken
    place from pure and applied mathematics to geometric modeling and
    robotics, and to artificial neural networks. This book provides a
    systematic and uniform treatment of elimination algorithms that
    compute various zero decompositions for systems of multivariate 
    polynomials. The central concepts are triangular sets and systems of
    different kinds, in terms of which the decompositions are
    represented. The prerequisites for the concepts and algorithms are
    results from basic algebra and some knowledge of algorithmic
    mathematics.",

    "This paper presents a novel technique for manipulating structures
    which represents infinite power series.
    
    When power series are implemented using lazy evaluation, many
    operations can be written as simple recursive procedures. For example,
    the programs to generate the series for the elementary transcendental
    functions are almost transliterations of the defining integral
    equations. However, a naive lazy algorithm provides an implementation
    which may be orders of magnitude slower than a method which
    manipulates the coefficients explicitly.
    
    The technique described here allows a power series to be defined in a
    very natural but computationally inefficient way and transforms it to
    an equivalent, efficient form. This is achieved by using a fixed point
    operator on the delayed part to remove redundant calculations.
    
    This paper describes this fixed point method and the class of problems
    to which it is applicable. It has been used in Scratchpad II to
    improve the performance of a number of operations on infinite series,
    including division, reversion, special functions and the solution of
    linear and non-linear ordinary differential equations.
    
    A few examples are given of the method and of the speed up
    obtained. To illustrate, the computation of the first $n$ terms of
    exp($u$) for a dense, infinite series $u$ is reduced from $O(n^4)$ to
    $O(n^2)$ coefficient operations, the same as required by the standard

    "Scratchpad II is a language developed at Yorktown Heights for the
    implementation of a new computer algebra system. The need to model the
    intricate relationships among the datatypes representing mathematical
    objects has provided a number of challenges in the design of a type
    system for the programming language.
    
    In languages in which a datatype constructor may take multiple
    parameters, ensuring compatibility between them is extremely
    important. Scratchpad II addresses this issue by basing its
    implementation of abstract datatypes on {\cl categories}. Categories
    provide a convenient and useful method for specifying requirements on
    operations from datatypes. These requirements can be very complex when
    modelling mathematics.
    
    We show how categories provide multiple inheritance and how
    inheritance of specification is separated from inheritance of
    implementation. We also present implications of the type system on
    compilation of efficient code and flexibility of a weakly typed
    interactive user interface.
    
    Finally, the mechanisms of Scratchpad II are compared with those of
    traditional abstract datatype and object-oriented programming
    languages.",

    "The $A^{#}$ compiler allows users of computer algebra to develop
    programs in a context where multiple programming languages are
    employed. The compiler translates programs written in the $A^{#}$
    programming language to a low-level intermediate language, Foam,
    from which it can generate stand-alone programs, native object
    libraries to be linked with other applications, or code to be read
    into closed environments. In addition, Foam code may be directly
    executed using an interpreter provided with the $A^{#}$ compiler.
    
    The $A^{#}$ programming language provides support for object-oriented
    and functional programming styles. It is ``higher-order'' in the sense
    that both types and functions are first class, and may be manipulated
    in the same ways as any other values. The primary considerations in
    the formulation of the language have been generality, composibility,
    and efficiency. The language has been designed to admit a number of
    important optimizations, allowing compilation to machine code which is
    in many instances of efficiency comparable to that produced by a C or
    Fortran compiler.
    
    The original motivation for $A^{#}$ comes from the field of computer
    algebra: to provide an improved extension language for the Axiom

    of {\sl type inference} is decidable. This result still holds if
    higher-order functions are present and {\sl parametric polymorphism}
    is used. These additional typing constructs are useful for further

    "In this book some of the most popular general purpose computer
    algebra systems (CAS), such as Mathematica, Maple, Derive, Axiom,
    MuPAD, and Macsyma, are examined. The strengths and weaknesses of
    these programs are compared and contrasted, and tutorial information
    for using these systems in various ways is given. The different
    packages are quantitatively compared using standard test suites,
    giving the possibility to asses the most appropriate for a particular
    user or application. The origins of these systems are revealed and
    many of their behaviors analyzed. This furnishes a feel for where the
    current computer algebra system state of the art stays and what can be
    expected for existing and future systems. The book is organized in
    several chapters written by different authors. Chapters 1,2, and 3 are
    organized as reviews, comparisons, and critiques of CAS
    capabilities. Then more technical issues are discussed considering
    different approaches taken by different CAS: simplifying square roots
    of square roots by denesting (chapter 4), complex number calculation
    (chapter 5), efficiently computing Chebyshev polynomials (chapter 6),
    solving single equations and systems of polynomial equations (chapters
    7, 8), computing limits (chapter 9), multiple integration (chapter
    10), solving ordinary differential equation (chapter 11), integration
    of nonlinear evolution equations (chapter 12), code generation
    (chapter 13), evaluation of expressions and programs in the embedded
    computer algebra programming language (chapter 14), and computer
    algebra in education (chapter 15). Chapter 16 covers the origin of CA,

    "Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and assume

    where $L=K(s_1,\cdots,s_n)$. Call, for the purposes of this review, an
    $n\times n$ matrix 1-tridiagonal if its entries above and below the
    main diagonal are all 1, the entries on it are $d_1,\cdots,d_n$, and
    all other entries are 0. Under which conditions can 
    $d_1,d_2,\cdots,d_n$ be chosen in a radical extension of $L$ such that 
    the resulting 1-tridiagonal matrix has $f$ as its characteristic 
    polynomial?  The author’s answer: for $n=3$ always. The $d_i,s_i$
    are related by a system of algebraic equations of the form
    $\overline{f}_i(d_1,d_2,d_3)=s_i$. If this is satisfied, then by 
    a resultant- or Groebner basis computation with respect to the 
    lexicographic order, $d_3$ (say) must be a root of a certain 
    irreducible polynomial $\varphi$ of degree 6. Joining this
    with a Galois group computation for $\varphi$ over $L$, it is shown 
    that a solvable and necessarily transitive Gal($\varphi$) will be a 
    necessary and sufficient condition for expressibility of $d_3$ (clear) 
    and, thanks to the form of the Groebner basis, also of $d_1,d_2$ in 
    radicals. Upon a discriminant computation of $\varphi$ and use of 
    results of G. Butler and J. McKay [Commun. Algebra 11,
    863-911 (1983; Zbl 0518.20003)] and J. McKay and L. Soicher [J. Number
    Theory 20, 273-281 (1985; Zbl 0579.12006)], this allows the author to
    deduce the mentioned result. For $n=4$, though the author cannot get as
    complete information about Galois groups etc., he can deduce e.g. that
    if $s_1,\cdots,s_4$ are algebraically independent over $\mathbb{Q}$, 
    then $d_1,\cdots,d_4$ are not expressible in radicals over 
    $\mathbb{Q}(s_1,\cdots,s_4)$. He mentions, however, a solvable subcase.",

  abstract = 
    "Equational theorem proving is interesting both from a mathematical
    and a computational point of view. Many mathematical structures like
    monoids, groups, etc. can be described by equational axioms. So the
    theory of free monoids, free groups, etc. is the equational theory
    defined by these axioms. A decision procedure for the equational
    theory is a solution for the word problem over the associated
    algebraic structure. From a computational point of view, abstract data
    types are basically described by equations. Thus, proving properties
    of an abstract data type amounts to proving theorems in the associated
    equational theory.

    One approach to equational theorem proving consists in associating a
    direction with the equational axioms, thus transforming them into
    rewrite rules. Now in order to prove an equation $a=b$, the rewrite
    rules are applied to both sides, finally yielding reduced versions
    $a^{'}$ and $b^{'}$ of the left and right hand sides, respectively. If
    $a^{'}$ and $b^{'}$ agree syntactically, then the equation holds in
    the equational theory. However, in general this argument cannot be
    reversed; $a^{'}$ and $b^{'}$ might be different even if $a=b$ is a
    theorem. The reason for this problem is that the rewrite system might
    not have the Church-Rosser property. So the goal is to take the
    original rewrite system and transform it into an equivalent one which
    has the desired Church-Rosser property.

    We show how rewrite systems can be used for proving theorems in
    equational and inductive theories, and how an equational specification
    of a problem can be turned into a rewrite program.",

    "This book surveys algorithms and results of Computer Algebra that are
    concerned with polynomials. It introduces algorithms from the bottom
    up, starting from very basic problems in computation over the
    integers, and finally leading to, e.g. advanced topics in
    factorization, solution of polynomial equations and constructive
    algebraic geometry. It is not based on a particular computer algebra
    program system.
    
    After two introductory chapters, the book contains six chapters with
    the following respective topics: computation by homomorphic images,
    gcd computation, factorization and decomposition of polynomials,
    linear systems and Hankel systems, Gröbner bases. The last three
    chapters are concerned with applications of polynomial algorithms to
    higher level problems in computer algebra. In particular, a decision
    algorithm in the elementary theory of real closed fields, a
    description of Gosper’s algorithm for solving summation problems, and
    an algorithm for deciding whether an algebraic curve can be
    parametrized by rational functions (and if so for computing such a
    parametrization) is given. Along the way, the complexity of many of
    the algorithms is investigated. Each chapter ends with rich
    bibliographical notes.
    
    The book was originally developed from course material. It can easily
    be used as a textbook on the topic. Most subsections contain
    exercises. Solutions of some of the exercises are provided."

    precomputation of an integral basis, which makes the reduction

    One principle of structured programming is that a program should be
    separated into meaningful independent subprograms, which are then
    combined so that the relation of the parts to the whole can be clearly
    established.  This paper describes several alternative ways to compose
    programs. The main method used is to permit the programmer to denote
    by an expression the sequence of values taken on by a variable. The
    sequence is represented by a function called a stream, which is a
    functional analog of a coroutine. The conventional while and for loops
    of structured programming may be composed by a technique of stream
    processing (analogous to list processing), which results in more
    structured programs than the orignals. This technique makes it
    possible to structure a program in a natural way into its logically
    separate parts, which can then be considered independently."

    The aim of this paper is to present how the dynamic evaluation method

    equality tests $(a=b?)$ and sign tests $(a > b?)$. Equality tests are

Springer-Verlag, pp56-60
  abstract = "
    Computer algebra systems of the new generation, like Scratchpad, are
    characterized by a very rich type concept, which models the
    relationship between mathematical domains of computation. To use these
    systems interactively, however, the user should be freed of type
    information. A type inference mechanism determines the appropriate
    function to call. All known models which allow to define a semantics
    for type inference cannot express the rich ``mathematical'' type
    structure, so presently type inference is done heuristically.  The
    following paper defines a semantics for a subproblem thereof, namely
    coercion, which is based on rewrite rules. From this definition, and
    efficient coercion algorith for Scratchpad is constructed using graph
    techniques."

  abstract = "
    The automatic computation of limits can be reduced to two main
    sub-problems. The first one is asymptotic comparison where one must
    decide automatically which one of two functions in a specified class
    dominates the other one asymptotically. The second one is asymptotic
    cancellation and is usually exemplified by
    \[e^x[exp(1/x+e^{-x})-exp(1/x)],\quad{}x \leftarrow \infty\]

    In this example, if the sum is expanded in powers of $1/x$, the
    expansion always yields $O(x^{-k})$, and this is not enough to
    conclude.

    In 1990, J.Shackell found an algorithm that solved both these problems
    for the case of $exp-log$ functions, i.e. functions build by recursive
    application of exponential, logarithm, algebraic extension and field
    operations to one variable and the rational numbers. D. Gruntz and
    G. Gonnet propose a slightly different algorithm for exp-log
    functions.  Extensions to larger classes of functions are also
    discussed.",

    "The object of the paper is to prove that the differential equation
    \[u^{'}(t)=t-[u(t)]^2\] 
    has no solutions which can be written using elementary functions, or
    anti-derivatives of elementary functions, or exponentials of such
    anti-derivatives, or anti-derivative of those, etc. We should note
    that Equation 1 can be solved using power series, integrals which
    depend on a parameter, or Bessel functions of order $1/3$.  However,
    as we will see, none of these methods of solution are ``algebraic'' in
    nature.

    We aim to give a precise definition of ``algebraic'' by developing the
    theory of {\sl differential algebra}, which is largely the work of
    Ritt. Other contributors are Liouville, Picard, Vessoit, Kolchin,
    Rosenlicht, ... The part of differential Galois theory which leads to

    "This thesis is dedicated to polynomial system solving by means of
    triangular sets. A first prt presents two algorithms to compute
    polynomial gcds over tower of simple extensions. The first one was
    designed by Renaud Rioboo and applies to algebraic towers. The second
    one is a generalization of the previous one to the most general case
    of seperable towers. These algorithms lead to an efficient
    implementation of two methods suggested by Daniel Lazard to solve
    polynomial systems by means of triangular sets. These programs solved
    problems that were previously unreachable. The second method was only
    sketched by its author. So, a second part of this thesis presents the
    necessary developements to describe a right implementation. Moreover,
    a theorecal and unified presentation, together with an experimental
    comparison with similar methods due to Wu Wen-Tsun, Dongming Wang and
    Michael Kalkbrener were realized by Philippe Aubry and are reported in

    In my pamphlet, I claim that this ``blazing new technology'' is
    actually a step backwards in the development of the domains that it
    tries to tackle, and the better means of expression, or better tools
    for doing the job, were available at least since the 70s, and recently
    they were only getting better.

    This pamphlet explores and expresses various {\sl computational

    "Polynomial systems can be found in many industrial applications. They
    are also in the heart of effective algebraic geometry. A fundamental
    tool for studying them is the Groebner bases. The knowledge of this
    paricular base of the ideal generated by the polynomials composing the
    system allows us to compute in $A=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$, the quotient
    algebra, and this is necessary when we try to solve. Nevertheless,
    Groebner bases computations rely heavily on the introduction of
    monomial ordering. This introduces a certain rigidity in the
    computation and thus numerical instability. We propose a new algorithm
    that tries to remedy that problem. It generalises Groebner bases
    computation and is much less numerically instable. To do this, we
    decrease the requirement of monomial ordering, and use a new normal
    form criterion. We then give an algorithm and prove its termination
    and correctness when the input polynomial system is
    0-dimensional. After, we compare it with the previously known methods
    and show how it can be seen as a generalisation of them. Next, we
    detail how we implemented it in C++ using the Synaps library. We also
    describe the sparse matrix elimination algorithm we used in or
    program. Finally, we present some of the experiments we have done with
    our program in domains like computer vision, algorithmic geometry,
    robotics, or pharmacology.",

  abstract = 
    "Various algebraic models have been used to implement symbolic
    procedures for solving summations and recurrences. Surprisingly, one
    model that has received little attention in the development of
    symbolic algorithms is generating functions. Generating function
    methods for discrete mathematics provide an ad hoc collection of
    techniques for solving summations and recurrences. In this work we
    consider their systematic application to symbolic computation.
     
    To demonstrate the feasibility and capabilities of generating
    functions as an algebraic model of computation, we develop and
    implement algorithms for manipulating generating functions and the
    sequences that they encode. In particular, we concentrate on
    algorithms for solving summations and recurrences. Techniques are
    developed to handle special functions and hybrid terms, which are
    terms involving two or more factors.
     
    Given various classes of summations and recurrences we develop a
    theory to characterize the form of their solution. This allows us to
    demonstrate the ability of our algorithms to solve problems of these
    classes. This knowledge also assists us in developing algorithms that
    know where to look for a solution rather than doing an ad hoc search
    for a solution."

    We describe the development of a repository of mathematical knowledge
    based on transformation rules. The specific mathematical problem is
    indefinite integration. It is important that the repository be not
    confused with a look-up table. The database of transformation rules is
    at present encoded in Mathematica, but this is only one convenient
    form of the repository, and it could be readily translated into other
    formats. The principles upon which the set of rules is compiled is
    described. One important principle is minimality. The benefits of the
    approach are illustrated with examples, and with the results of
    comparisons with other approaches.",

    Bracket coefficients for polynomials are introduced. These are like
    specific precision floating point numbers together with error
    terms. Working in terms of bracket coefficients, an algorithm that
    computes a Gr{\"o}bner basis with floating point coefficients is
    presented, and a new criterion for determining whether a bracket
    coefficient is zero is proposed. Given a finite set $F$ of polynomials
    with real coefficients, let $G_\mu$ be the result of the algorithm for
    $F$ and a precision $\mu$, and $G$ be a true Gr{\"o}bner basis of
    $F$. Then, as $\mu$ approaches infinity, $G_\mu$ converges to $G$
    coefficientwise. Moreover, there is a precision $M$ such that if 
    $\mu \ge M$, then the sets of monomials with non-zero coefficients of
    $G_\mu$ and $G$ are exactly the same. The practical usefulness of the

    "We identify three main objectives for computer aided reasoning
    enhancing the techniques available for mathematical experimentation,
    developing community standards for experiment and modelling and
    developing methods which will make computation more acceptable as part
    of a proof. We discuss three areas of research which address these:
    the use of theorem proving techniques to enhance or extend
    mathematical software systems, support for formal methods techniques
    to increase the reliability of such systems, and the use of computer
    aided formal reasoning in support of mathematical practice. This last
    includes activities such as formalizing systems for computational
    mathematics or visualization so that they can still be used informally
    but generate a formal development, and developing techniques to
    provide assistance in the initial stages of developing a new theory.

    By mathematics here we mean the activities of working research
    mathematicians, producing new results in pure or applied mathematics,
    although we touch briefly on some questions concerning the
    applications of computational mathematics and simulation in research
    science and engineering. We have left out several other related areas
    entirely: logical questions of decidability, soundness or
    completeness, theoretical computer science issues of semantics,
    computability or complexity, foundational issues such as
    constructivity, computer aided proofs about software and hardware, and
    the use of computers in mathematical education at all levels and in
    heuristic discovery. In particular foundational questions about
    computation have transformed mathematical logic, computation has made
    constructive proof feasible, and effective notions of practice for
    proofs about hardware and software are by no means well understood.
    However these matters fall outside the scope of this paper.",

    Drawing on the past work of Maring, Moses, and Engelman, it extends
    the capabilities of automated algebraic manipulation systems in
    several areas, including

    a) limit calculations
    b) symbolic integration
    c) solution of equations
    d) canonical simplification
    e) user-level pattern matching
    f) user-specified expression manipulation
    g) programming and bookkeeping assistance

    MACSYMA makes extensive use of the power of its rational function

    considerable detail.

    We give algorithms for the computation of the $d$-th digit of certain
    transcendental numbers in various bases. These algorithms can be
    easily implemented (multiple precision arithmetic is not needed),
    require virtually no memeory, and feature run times that scale nearly
    linearly with the order of the digit desired. They make it feasible to
    compute, for example, the billionth binary digit of log(2) or $\pi$ on
    a modest work station in a few hours run time.

    We demonstrate this technique by computing the ten billionth
    hexadecimal digit of $\pi$, the billionth hexadecimal digits of
    $\pi^2$, log(2), and log${}^2$(2), and the ten billionth decimal digit
    of log(9/10).

    These calculations rest on the observation that very special types of
    identities exist for certain numbers like $\pi$, $\pi^2$, log(2) and
    log${}^2$. These are essentially polylogarithmic ladders in an integer
    base. A number of these identities that we derive in this work appear
    to be new, for example the critical identity for $\pi$:

    \[\pi=\sum_{i=0}^\infty{\frac{1}{16^i}\left(
    \frac{4}{8i+1}-\frac{2}{8i+4}-\frac{1}{8i+5}-\frac{1}{8i+6}\right)}\]",

    proof and publication, to archival and sharing of data and code.

    OpenDreamKit will be built out of a sustainable ecosystem of
    community-developed open software, databases, and ser- vices,
    including popular tools such as LINBOX, MPIR, SAGE (sagemath.org),
    GAP, PARI/GP, LMFDB, and SINGULAR. We will extend the JUPYTER Notebook
    environment to provide a flexible user interface. By improving and
    unifying existing build- ing blocks, OpenDreamKit will maximise both
    sustainability and impact, with beneficiaries extending to scientific
    computing, physics, chemistry, biology and more, and including
    researchers, teachers, and industrial practitioners.

    We will define a novel component-based VRE architecture and adapt
    existing mathematical software, databases, and user interface
    components to work well within it on varied platforms. Interfaces to
    standard HPC and grid services will be built in. Our architecture will
    be informed by recent research into the sociology of mathematical
    collaboration, so as to properly support actual research practice. The
    ease of set up, adaptability and global impact will be demonstrated in
    a variety of demonstrator VREs.

    We will ourselves study the social challenges associated with
    large-scale open source code development and publications based on
    executable documents, to ensure sustainability.

    OpenDreamKit will be conducted by a Europe-wide steered by demand
    collaboration, including leading mathematicians, computational
    researchers, and software developers with a long track record of
    delivering innovative open source software solutions for their
    respective communities. All produced code and tools will be open

%%%                        Scratchpad and AXIOM were developed at IBM
%%%                        research laboratories over many years before
%%%                        they were offered as supported products.
%%%                        Today, AXIOM is marketed for several
%%%                        platforms by the Numerical Algorithms Group,
%%%                        Inc. (NAG) (Downer's Grove, IL, USA. and
%%%                        Oxford, UK), and versions are available in
%%%                        late 1995 for Hewlett--Packard 9000 (HP-UX),
%%%                        IBM RS/6000 (AIX), and Sun (SunOS) systems,

%%%                        NAG maintains an AXIOM code and documentation

%%%                        In 2006, AXIOM became free software, with a
