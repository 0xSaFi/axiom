{\Large{\bf New Foreword}}
\vskip .25in

On October 1, 2001 Axiom was withdrawn from the market and ended
life as a commercial product.
On September 3, 2002 Axiom was released under the Modified BSD
license, including this document.
On August 27, 2003 Axiom was released as free and open source
software available for download from the Free Software Foundation's
website, Savannah.

Work on Axiom has had the generous support of the Center for 
Algorithms and Interactive Scientific Computation (CAISS) at
City College of New York. Special thanks go to Dr. Gilbert 
Baumslag for his support of the long term goal.

The online version of this documentation is roughly 1000 pages.
In order to make printed versions we've broken it up into three
volumes. The first volume is tutorial in nature. The second volume
is for programmers. The third volume is reference material. We've
also added a fourth volume for developers. All of these changes
represent an experiment in print-on-demand delivery of documentation.
Time will tell whether the experiment succeeded.

Axiom has been in existence for over thirty years. It is estimated to
contain about three hundred man-years of research and has, as of
September 3, 2003, 143 people listed in the credits. All of these
people have contributed directly or indirectly to making Axiom
available.  Axiom is being passed to the next generation. I'm looking
forward to future milestones.

With that in mind I've introduced the theme of the ``30 year horizon''.
We must invent the tools that support the Computational Mathematician
working 30 years from now. How will research be done when every bit of
mathematical knowledge is online and instantly available? What happens
when we scale Axiom by a factor of 100, giving us 1.1 million domains?
How can we integrate theory with code? How will we integrate theorems
and proofs of the mathematics with space-time complexity proofs and
running code? What visualization tools are needed? How do we support
the conceptual structures and semantics of mathematics in effective
ways? How do we support results from the sciences? How do we teach
the next generation to be effective Computational Mathematicians?

The ``30 year horizon'' is much nearer than it appears.

\section{Elementary Functions\cite{4}}
\subsection{Rationale for Branch Cuts and Identities}

Perhaps one of the most vexing problems to be addressed when
attempting to determine a set of mathematical function definitions is
the choice of the principal branches of the inverses of the
exponential, trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and, further, the
mathematical form that these functions take on their domains (the
complex plane slit by the corresponding branch cuts). The fundamental
issue facing the mathematical library developer is the plethora of
possibilities, and while some choices are demonstrably inferior, there
is rarely a choice which is clearly best.

Following Kahan [1], we will refer to the mathematical formula we use
to define the principal branch of each such function as its principal
expression. For the inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic
functions, this principal expression is given in terms of the
functions $\ln{}z$ and $\sqrt{z}$.

The choices set out in this Standard are derived from the following
principles:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Branch cuts must lie completely within either the real or imaginary axis.
\item The principal expression must not have any singularities at finite 
points which the original function does not share.
\item Branch cuts end at branch points.
\item Where not otherwise determined, the value of a function on its branch 
cut or cuts is obtained by taking a limit along a path which approaches the 
branch cut in a counterclockwise manner around one of the branch points 
which terminate the cut (“counterclockwise continuity”, or CCC for short).
\item Each inverse trigonometric or hyperbolic function must be real-valued 
on the range of the corresponding trigonometric or hyperbolic function when 
restricted to the real axis. 
\end{enumerate}

Further explanation of these principles can be found in [1].

While standard identities such as $\ln \frac{1}{x} = -\ln x$ hold for
$x > 0$, they generally fail to hold for complex
arguments of principal branches, even complex arguments which do not
lie on a branch cut. Consequently, a definition of, say, 
\[\arctan z =\frac{i}{2}(\ln(1-iz)-\ln(1+iz))\]
is not the same as the apparently equivalent 
\[i\ln\left(\sqrt\frac{1-iz}{1+iz}\right)\]. 
It can be challenging to decide if two candidate expressions for 
representing an inverse trigonometric or hyperbolic function which agree 
in the mathematical domain are the same in the restricted computational realm
of principal expressions.

If the underlying computational mathematical system supports a signed
zero, as prescribed by the IEEE/754 Standard [2], then a larger set of
identities will hold. For example, 
\[\ln \frac{1}{z} = -\ln z\] 
holds for all complex $z$ in such a system, as do
conjugate symmetry relations for functions such as
$\arcsin z$. However, identities such as $\ln zw = \ln z + \ln w$ 
still fail to hold for some complex $z$ and $w$.

A useful function for representing identities involving complex
functions which are related to the logarithm function is the complex
signum function, defined as:
\[
{\rm csgn}(z) = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{cc}
1, & \mbox{if }\Re z > 0 \mbox{ or }\Re z = 0\mbox{ and }\Im z > 0 \\
-1, & \mbox{if }\Re z < 0 \mbox{ or }\Re z = 0\mbox{ and }\Im z < 0 \\
\end{array}
\right.
\]

The value of ${\rm csgn}(0)$ is unspecified. Note, for example, that 
$\sqrt{z^2} = z {\rm csgn}(z)$.

Using the principal expressions for each of the 12 inverse
trigonometric and hyperbolic functions as given in this Standard, we
have the following relations and identities:
