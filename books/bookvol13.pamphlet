\begin{quote}
{\bf In contrast to humans, computers are good at performing formal
processes. There are people working hard on the project of actually
formalizing parts of mathematics by computer, with actual formally
correct formal deductions. I think this is a very big but very
worthwhile project, and I am confident that we will learn a lot from
it. The process will help simplify and clarify mathematics. In not too
many years, I expect that we will have interactive computer programs
that can help people compile significant chunks of formally complete
and correct mathematics (based on a few perhaps shaky but at least
explicit assumptions) and that they will become part of the standard
mathematicians's working environment.}

\begin{quote}
{\bf Our basic premise is that the ability to construct and modify programs
will not improve without a new and comprehensive look at the entire
programming process. Past theoretical research, say, in the logic of
programs, has tended to focus on methods for reasoning about
individual programs; little has been done, it seems to us, to develop
a sound understanding of the process of programming -- the process by
which programs evolve in concept and in practice. At present, we lack
the means to describe the techniques of program construction and
improvement in ways that properly link verification, documentation and
adaptability.}

\chapter{Here is a problem}
The goal is to prove that Axiom's implementation of 
the Euclidean GCD algorithm is correct.

From category EuclideanDomain (EUCDOM) we find the implementation of 
the Euclidean GCD algorithm:
\begin{verbatim}
      gcd(x,y) ==                --Euclidean Algorithm
         x:=unitCanonical x
         y:=unitCanonical y
         while not zero? y repeat
            (x,y):= (y,x rem y)
            y:=unitCanonical y   -- this doesn't affect the
                                 -- correctness of Euclid's algorithm,
                                 -- but
                                 -- a) may improve performance
                                 -- b) ensures gcd(x,y)=gcd(y,x)
                                 --    if canonicalUnitNormal
         x
\end{verbatim}
The unitCanonical function comes from the category IntegralDomain (INTDOM)
where we find:
\begin{verbatim}
    unitNormal: % -> Record(unit:%,canonical:%,associate:%)
        ++ unitNormal(x) tries to choose a canonical element
        ++ from the associate class of x.
        ++ The attribute canonicalUnitNormal, if asserted, means that
        ++ the "canonical" element is the same across all associates of x
        ++ if \spad{unitNormal(x) = [u,c,a]} then
        ++ \spad{u*c = x}, \spad{a*u = 1}.
    unitCanonical: % -> %
        ++ \spad{unitCanonical(x)} returns \spad{unitNormal(x).canonical}.
\end{verbatim}
implemented as
\begin{verbatim}
      UCA ==> Record(unit:%,canonical:%,associate:%)
      if not (% has Field) then
        unitNormal(x) == [1$%,x,1$%]$UCA -- the non-canonical definition
      unitCanonical(x) == unitNormal(x).canonical -- always true
      recip(x) == if zero? x then "failed" else _exquo(1$%,x)
      unit?(x) == (recip x case "failed" => false; true)
      if % has canonicalUnitNormal then
         associates?(x,y) ==
           (unitNormal x).canonical = (unitNormal y).canonical
       else
         associates?(x,y) ==
           zero? x => zero? y
           zero? y => false
           x exquo y case "failed" => false
           y exquo x case "failed" => false
           true
\end{verbatim}

\section{Approaches}
There are several systems that could be applied to approach the proof.

The plan is to initially look at Coq and ACL2.  Coq seems to be
applicable at the Spad level. ACL2 seems to be applicable at the Lisp
level. Both levels are necessary for a proper proof.

Coq is very close to Spad in spirit so we can use it for the
high-level proofs.

ACL2 is a Lisp-level proof technology which can be used to prove
the Spad-to-Lisp level.

There is an LLVM to ACL2 translator which can be used to move from
the GCL Lisp level to the hardware since GCL compiles to C.
In particular, the "Vellvm: Verifying the LLVM" \cite{Zdan14}
project is important.

Quoting from Hardin \cite{Hard14}
\begin{quote}
LLVM is a register-based intermediate in Static Single Assignment
(SSA) form. As such, LLVM supports any number of registers, each of
which is only assigned once, statically (dynamically, of course, a
given register can be assigned any number of times). Appel has
observed that ``SSA form is a kind of functional programming''; this
observation, in turn, inspired us to build a translator from LLVM to
the applicative subset of Common Lisp accepted by the ACL2 theorem
prover. Our translator produces an executable ACL2 specification that
is able to efficiently support validation via testing, as the
generated ACL2 code features tail recursion, as well as in-place
updates via ACL2's single-threaded object (stobj) mechanism. In order
to ease the process of proving properties about these translated
functions, we have also developed a technique for reasoning about
tail-recursive ACL2 functions that execute in-place, utilizing a
formally proven ``bridge'' to primitive-recursive versions of those
functions operating on lists.
\end{quote}

{\center{\includegraphics{ps/v13llvmtoacl2.eps}}}

Hardin \cite{Hard13} describes the toolchain thus:
\begin{quote}
Our translation toolchain architecture is shown in Figure 1. The left
side of tthe figure depicts a typical compiler frontend producing LLVM
intermediate code. LLVM output can be produced either as a binary
``bitcode'' (.bc) file, or as text (.ll file). We chose to parse the
text form, producing an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of
the LLVM program. Our translator then converts the AST to ACL2
source. The ACL2 source file can then be admitted into an ACL2
session, along with conjectures that one wishes to prove about the
code, which ACL2 processes mostly automatically. In addition to
proving theorems about the translated LLVM code, ACL2 can also be used
to execute test vectors at reasonable speed.
\end{quote}

Note that you can see the intermediate form from clang with
\begin{verbatim}
clang -O4 -S -emit-llvm foo.c
\end{verbatim}

Both Coq and the Hardin translator use OCAML \cite{OCAM14} so we will have to
learn that language.

\chapter{Theory}
The proof of the Euclidean algorithm has been known since Euclid.
We need to study an existing proof and use it to guide our use of
Coq along the same lines, if possible. Some of the ``obvious''
natural language statements may require Coq lemmas.

From WikiProof \cite{Wiki14a} we quote:

Let \[a, b \in \Z\] and $a \ne 0 or b \ne 0$.

The steps of the algorithm are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start with $(a,b)$ such that $\abs{a} \ge \abs{b}$.
If $b = 0$ then the task is complete and the GCD is $a$.
\item if $b \ne 0$ then you take the remainder $r$ of $a/b$.
\item set $a \leftarrow b$, $b \leftarrow r$ (and thus
$\abs{a} \ge \abs{b}$ again).
\item repeat these steps until $b = 0$
\end{enumerate}
Thus the GCD of $a$ and $b$ is the value of the variable $a$ 
at the end of the algorithm.

The proof is:

Suppose \[a, b \in \Z\] and $a or b \ne 0$.

From the {\bf division theorem}, $a = qb + r$ 
where $0 \le r \le \abs{b}$

From {\bf GCD with Remainder}, the GCD of $a$ and $b$ is also the GCD
of $b$ and $r$.

Therefore we may search instead for the $gcd(b,r)$.

Since $\abs{r} \ge \abs{b}$ and \[b \in \Z\],
we will reach $r = 0$ after finitely many steps.

At this point, $gcd(r,0) = r$ from {\bf GCD with Zero}.

We quote the {\bf Division Theorem} proof \cite{Wiki14b}:

For every pair of integers $a$, $b$ where $b \ne 0$, there exist unique
integers $q,r$ such that $a = qb + r$ and $0 \le r \le \abs{b}$.
