Hello! How was axiom's bookvol10.2.pamphlet file generated?

Subject: How was axiom's bookvol10.2.pamphlet file
	generated?

The pamphlet file was hand generated. Pamphlet files are the source
code of the system.All of the pamphlet files are source code and are
hand generated in latex.

The system is moving to using pure latex rather than using noweb for the
pamphlet format. A new latex "chunk" environment was written to support
this. All of the new latex macros are in the axiom.sty file. Volume 10.2
(the category structure) is still in noweb format for the moment but this
will change.

Axiom's source structure is being moved from the "tree-of-tiny-files"
structure into a "literate software" structure. The process involves
rewriting the source code into straight common lisp. Each function is
rewritten and placed into one of the pamphlets in the books directory.
This phase takes a while as there are about 1M "things of code" that
need to be rewritten. Work is currently being done in volume 5 (the
interpreter) and volume 9 (the compiler).

The next step is to organize and document the system using these books.
The ultimate idea is that you will be able to read the system as a
series of novels, moving from ideas to implementation.

Volume 10.2 (categories) is the category structure of the system.
It is currently in alphabetical order but that will change in whatever
way needed to support the human documentation.

Tim,

These are very good, I haven't come across them before.

I especially like part 2 and the link between category theory string diagrams 
and combinators. Its interesting about adding iterators to combinators, it 
would be good to implement that.

Also there was a throwaway line, something about removing the crossover 
cancellation rule from combinators gives braids. I thought before that it 
would be interesting to implement braid groups and I wonder if it could be 
done using combinators?

Also string diagrams/combinators being so graphical reminds me once again how 
much I would like a 2-way graphical interface to Axiom.

Martin,

If you are thinking about category theory and graphical calculus you
might be interesting in

http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/projects/quantomatic/
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/quantomatic
http://sites.google.com/site/quantomatic/publications

A lot of this work is being done in the context of quantum computation
but the tools are much more general. The system uses the theorem
proving package Isabelle

http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/

to reason about graphs and Poly/ML (a variant of standard ML that is
even more like SPAD) and Java for data structures and GUI.

This video

http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/quantum/content/1005019/

is a pretty good introduction.

I became especially interested in this while implementing linear
operators as an extension of the Axiom CartesianTensor domain. See:

http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/LinearOperator

I think it would be great if there was a group of people who were
motivated to add something like this to Axiom.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Whew. Thanks for that. 
Constructing a gentoo machine is a bit of work.
If you look at the download page of the Axiom website
http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/download.html
there is a section called "Compile Notes".

If you write up a Gentoo section I will include it.

Try this:

integrate(1/(2*x-1)^3/(x*(x-1)^2)^(1/3),x)

if you'd like to heat the room.

80 minutes and counting here.

(The integral comes from a (15 year old) bug report in reduce's svn.)

If you look through the published test suite,
especially at the rich* files, you will find some
integrals that are commented out due to run time.

Winter's coming so these might be helpful.

And how were graphs generated from this pamphlet? I mean dotfull and dotabb. The latter is supplied with axiom sources (in axiom/src/axiom-website), but I want to have dot source for the full name graph.

The graph information is kept with each category in chunks
of the form <<CATEGORYNAME.dotfull>> and <<CATEGORYNAME.dotabb>>

At the end of the file there are chunks named <<dotfull>> and
<<dotabb>>. You can extract the dot files with the command

notangle -Rdotfull bookvol10.2.pamphlet >dotfull
notangle -Rdotabb bookvol10.2.pamphlet >dotabb

The notangle function lives in $AXIOM/bin/lib so you 
need to add this to the path. So try:

export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/ubuntu
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin/lib:$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
