Take care,

I'm still here. I have taken a bit of a vacation from updates after so
many years. I did some consulting work that took up all of my free time.

Now that I'm unemployed I expect to get back to regular changes.

How's life there?

Tim

Axiom doesn't run on any version of Windows. It probably never will
again, although it used to. I don't plan to put any effort into it.

Axiom has literate programming support implemented in lisp so it is
already platform independent. The Axiom )tangle command is available
at the command prompt.

All literate files in Axiom are, or soon will be, pure latex.
The noweb implementation is being phased out.

Subject: Documentation Document broken

Hi,

It looks like the document "axiom-endpaper.pdf" is broken.

* The lists of packages on page 6 and page 9 are cut of.
* Pages 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 are empty.

Please fix.


ys, John

The file endpaper.pdf on the axiom-developer.org website has been fixed.

The endpaper.pamphlet file containing the source will be pushed after
I run a system build and test cycle, probably by later today.

Thanks for the update.

Subject: Re: Windows Support is broken

Actually, the very old version from the website
installed and runs on Windows/XP over Portable_Ubuntu after a rebuild;
I did a reinstall from a backup copy a few months ago
and it still starts OK.

Since about 40% of desktop Windows users are XPatriots,
this should be kept in mind; it would not be rational
to expend any effort on a Windows specific version.

Cheers, Gene
