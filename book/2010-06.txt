Hi Martin,

In response to

> Also what is the best way to create and write to a text file?

Have you looked at the File constructor?


If you can work on a more standard graphics format, I think that would
be great.

As for
http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/standards/program/mycode/write/
you should note that many tools in PanAxiom were done before any other
programmers jumped in and created different and nowadays more often used
formats.

Maybe Tim knows a bit more about the history. Your conversion would
certainly be of interest for all the panAxiom systems.

Subject: exporting plots and other geometry information

I don't know if anyone is interested but I have written code to write the 
contents of a SubSpace domain to a Wavefront .OBJ file. If you are interested 
I have put the code with some documentation an instructions here:

http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/standards/program/mycode/graph/write/

While doing this I found the Axiom documentation a bit lacking in some areas 
(I needed to understand SubSpace, ThreeSpace and so on) so while I was doing 
this I took the opportunity to make some notes on existing axiom geometry 
related structures and put my notes here:
http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/standards/program/mycode/graph/existing/

I also have various issues, questions and so on about the more general issues 
of working with geometry in axiom here:

http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/standards/program/mycode/graph/

The motivation is to:

    * Export plots (with scales, axes, and so on) into a dedicated 3D editors 
(such as 'blender').
    * define and transform shapes using Clifford algebra as well as usual 
Matrix methods.
    * I also find it very helpful to be able to visualise the algebraic 
structures and I want to find better ways to do this.
    * define shapes and show union and intersection (join and meet)
    * slice through shapes and show sections.
    * show scales and grids
    * combine many graphs in one view
    * add annotations in 3D view.
    * Use structures that can be extended to n-dimensions and are not specific 
to 2 or 3(+ 1 for colour) dimensions.

As one example of the issues on this page : I would like to be able to export 
to a X3D file - which is more complicated and standards based than a Wavefront 
file since this can do things like text, lines and colour which would be 
useful for drawing scales etc. There seem to be many structures in axiom to 
implement Open Inventor (IVNodeCategory, RenderTools, IVSimpleInnerNode, 
IVSeparator, IVGroup, IVCoordinate3, IVQuadMesh, IVIndexedLineSet, 
IVUtilities). Would it be feasible to adapt this to support X3D?

Excellent. I'll try to incorporate it and test it.
If all goes well it'll make the next release.

Tim,

Thats great, while I am on a roll is there any chance that I could persuade 
you to include the HTML formatter (html.spad.pamphlet) which is here:
http://github.com/martinbaker/multivector/

into the new release? I have put the reasons why I think its useful here:
http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/standards/program/mycode/output/

I mentioned it some time ago, did you have any thoughts about its usefulness 
or otherwise?

Thanks,

Martin Baker

Subject: new release and SuSE Linux

Tim,

Would it be possible to check the planned new release under SuSE Linux 
(because on  SuSE the virtual memory limit is set low by default).

All that is necessary to check the problem is to run something that uses a bit 
of memory like draw and also to try to compile something from the command 
line. That is )co somefile.

and if required put:

ulimit -v unlimited

in the startup script. Or at lest put a warning about this on the release 
notes.

Even better would be to put into the SuSE build service like OpenAxiom have 
done.  As you can see here:

http://software.opensuse.org/search?p=1&baseproject=ALL&q=open-axiom

this automatically generates rpms not only for SuSE but also for Fedora, 
Mandriva, etc.

Unfortunately I don't have any skills or knowledge in doing this otherwise I 
would offer to help.

Martin Baker

I looked at the build farm wiki but it is confusing.
I don't have the "skills and knowledge" to do this either :-)

I'll look into this server farm. At the moment I have a local
machine that does a SUSE build. What is the problem you are
seeing that needs to be solved?

I used to build Axiom on an HP server farm but that died.
I used to build Axiom on a slashdot server farm but that died.
Eventually I gave up and created my own server farm.
Currently I have 9 machines in my home office.
I need some other machines but cost is an issue (who said free
software is free? :-) )


Camm Maquire is currently updating the Debian version of
Axiom to a recent release. He is also working to fix the
issues with Mac OS X so stay tuned.

I tried to create a "cloud server farm". At the May release
I built a cloud machine on Amazon's cloud and successfully
compiled Axiom there. However this was only for one system.
I ran out of time to really study the problem. I would like to
have a large set of cloud machines set up and ready to go at
release time since it takes a few days to do a release, mostly
in doing hand-build/hand-checking of binaries.

Axiom is in "continuous build" locally. Every update of Axiom's
silver version is built and tested before the sources are pushed to
the silver hosts, currently about 3-4 times a day. The limiting
factor is the number of stupid mistakes I make which, fortunately,
rarely get passed the local build server checks.

Silver sources live on:

sourceforge.net/projects/axiom
savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom
axiom-developer.org
axiom-developer.com
axiom-developer.net

Axiom Gold version is at github. Gold is updated every 2 months.

Tim,

OK, looks like you have things well in hand and you are obviously very busy 
with all this so it probably best if I don't take up any more of your time 
now.

Just for the record this is the issue that I was seeing (in the unlikely event 
that your tests could have missed it).

When I first started using Axiom last year with the May 2009 release and 
openSUSE 11.1 and I was getting:

>> System error:
Unknown bfd format

whenever draw was called or when I tried to compile an SPAD file.

However since then there have been lots of new versions of Axiom and a new 
version of openSUSE and I must admit I have lost track of which combinations 
that I have tried and if I added:
ulimit -v unlimited
to the startup script.

So when you release the new software I will try it and let you know if there 
is still an issue (openSUSE 11.3 is coming soon so I will try on that).

Thanks,

Martin Baker

Great. The testing feedback is always welcome.

I'm bogged down right now working through another
CATS integration test suite. Lots of interesting
things are turning up.

I spend a week every 2 months looking at build issues
and general "product cleanup" just before each release.
The next scheduled release is July, likely July 23 if
history is any guide. Hopefully SUSE11.1 will be out
by then. I'll also take a deeper look at the build farm
idea you mentioned.

Subject: Re: Common ground

Rich, Dave,

tl;dr Axiom works and shows shorter integrals in many cases.

I finished the first pass analysis of the 276 "rational" integrands.
This file was run to compare Rich's integration with Axiom's integration.
Rich is using Rule-based integration, Axiom is using algorithms.

I found 10 exact matches, that is, Axiom's output is exactly Rich's output.

I found 98 differ by a constant.

I found 136 that differ by a variable amount. However, this is due to
two things. First, there is difference in "solution basis" where sometimes
Rich uses atan where Axiom uses logs. These differences all disappear in
the derivative or under normalization. Second, the form of the result
may include negatives under logs or differing square roots. Both of these
spurious differences disappear under derivative or normalization.

All of the integrations succeeded.

Axiom is visibly shorter in 57 cases and may be shorter in more.
I have not yet written a "leaf counter" function so I don't have
a more reliable value.

There a couple things that need further work, namely
0240, 0241, 0244-0247, and 0261. I will revisit these later.


The results are at http://daly.axiom-developer.org/richrational.input.pdf
This file has a summary at the top showing several columns.

Column 1 is the integrand number.

Column 2 is Rich's integrand.
         "ok" means there are no syntax errors.

Column 3 is Axiom' integrand.
         "ok" means it integrated
         "exact" means that the results are exactly the same.

Column 4 is the difference between Rich and Axiom.
         "var" means there is a 'x' in the difference
         "constant" means there is no 'x' in the difference
         0 means the answers are equal

Column 5 is the derivative of the difference.
         0 means that the integrals differ by at most a constant

Once the summary portion is complete the actual results are shown.
There are 5 sections per integrand,
   tnnnn is the integrand
   rnnnn is Rich's integral
   annnn is Axiom's integral
   mnnnn is the difference
   dnnnn is the derivative
  NOTE: sometimes Axiom has 2 results per integral. Both are listed.


I'll start the analysis of the other files shortly.

Tim

Sorry to annoy, but I can't succeed in compiling axiom.

I am trying to do it on an ubuntu64 10.04 system. I followed all=20
instructions on the download page, namely:

echo 0 >/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
apt-get install m4 libxpm-dev libxt-dev x-dev libx11-dev

git clone git://axiom.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/axiom/axiom
cd axiom
export AXIOM=3D`pwd`/mnt/ubuntu
export PATH=3D$AXIOM/bin:$PATH

It starts compiling and, after about 10 minutes, it stops with the=20

Is this the problem?

Another question: I have 8 Gb of RAM.
I would like that axiom uses most of it. Say, 7 Gb.
What should I change in the source to acheive this?

Moreover, is there a variable to set to force a binary version of axiom to=

Fabio,

I have seen this before.
The problem occurs earlier in the build.
I don't have a 64 bit system available at the moment
so I cannot test it here. Type:

   make NOISE=3D

and send me the output.

What about the RAM? Is it a trivial question?
If I am not wrong, axiom uses only up to 1Gb of RAM: on modern systems=20
this can be a limit.

Maybe you should try

make NOISE= &> fabio.log

and upload that file somewhere. Maybe in a sandbox at
http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/FrontPage
or go to http://sites.google.com create a site and upload fabio.log.

Just the last lines is not enough.

What I saw from your previous mail looked quite strange to me.

Especially the line

compiling AHYP.spad to AHYP.nrlib

Maybe Tim has changed the case, but usually it was .NRLIB with capital 
letters.

I uploaded it to Dropbox.

Here are the results:

the file make.log

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7972796/make.log

is the result of a plain "make".

The file make-noise.log

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7972796/make-noise.log

is the result of "make NOISE="

All file names in Axiom are lowercase everywhere
except the algebra files which are guaranteed to
be unique. This eliminates the problem of porting
to case-insensitive filesystems.

No, the problem isn't ram. I have seen this problem
before but it is my memory that is failing. I'll look
at it shortly.

Fabio,

type
  echo $AXIOM
and let me know what your AXIOM shell variable is.
It appears that it might not be set correctly.
It should be
export AXIOM=/home/stumbo/download/axiom/mnt/ubuntu

If you set it to that value and then do
  make clean
  make
it should build. The makefile knows where the build
is happening but Axiom requires the shell variable to
be the same as the build variable and this does not
appear to be the case.

Well, maybe I have not been correct, since I asked in the same message=20
about two _different_ problems.

I am not suggesting that the ram could be the reason for the=20
compilation problem.

Using all the ram is another problem: should I post it in a new, different=
=20
thread?

Concerning compilation, I will check for the environment variable as soon=
=20
as I am back in the office (later or tomorrow morning).

In a virtual memory environment 1G of ram should not be an issue.

AFAIK this limitation has little to do with Axiom, it comes from GCL.
IIRC that this is unavoidable using GCL 2.6.7. When using GCL 2.6.8
I think it is possible to enlarge the limit.  This question came out
few years ago and Camm Maguire (main GCL developer) gave the answer.
Either search the list archives or try to contact Camm.

[em243 16:52:32 axiom]$ echo $AXIOM
/home/stumbo/download/axiom/mnt/ubuntu

so the variable looks correct.
On the other hand, it was produced by

export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/ubuntu

and the same for PATH:

export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH

so I would have been quite surprised if it wasn't correct.

You also asked me about the source I used: I tried both with git
git clone git://axiom.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/axiom/axiom
and the source file in the download page
http://www.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/download.html

(but I checked that the resulting directory are exactly the same).

ok. I'll try a build from those sources again.
Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.
Did you say you had a 64 bit system?

I built ubuntu on a 64 bit machine and then did
git clone http://github.com/daly/axiom.git
cd axiom
export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/ubuntu
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
make

and it builds properly here.
