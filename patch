    "One of the great problems of Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)
    systems is to obtain access to a sufficiently large corpus of
    mathematical knowledge to allow the management / search / naviation
    techniques developed by the community to display their strength. Such
    systems usually expect the mathematical knowledge they operate on in
    the form of semantically enhanced documents, but mathematicians and
    publishers in Mathematics have heavily invested into the Tex/Latex
    format and workflow.
    
    We analyze the current practice of semi-semantic markup in Latex
    documents and extend it by a markup infrastructure that allows to
    embed semantic annotations into latex documents without changing their
    visual appearance. This collection of tex macro packages is called
    stex (semantic tex) as it allows to markup latex documents
    semantically without leaving the time-tried tex/latex workflow,
    essentially turning latex into an MKM format. At the heart of stex is
    a definition mechanism for semantic macros for mathematical objects
    and a non-standard scoping construct for them, which is oriented at
    the semantic dependency relation rather than the document structure.
    
    We evaulate the stex macro collection on a large case study: the
    course materials of a two-semester course in Computer Science was
    annotated semantically and coverted to the OMDOC MKM format by Bruce
    Miller's LatexML system.",
