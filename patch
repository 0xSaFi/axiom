    When building a cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) savings can
    be made in the presence of an equational constraint (EC): an equation
    logically implied by a formula.

    The present paper is concerned with how to use multiple ECs,
    propagating those in the input throughout the projection set. We
    improve on the approach of McCallum in ISSAC 2001 by using the reduced
    projection theory to make savings in the lifting phase (both to the
    polynomials we lift with and the cells lifted over). We demonstrate
    the benefits with worked examples and a complexity analysis."
