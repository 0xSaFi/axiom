    "This paper introduces singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithms
    for some standard polynomial computations, in the case where the
 
    coefficients are inexact or imperfectly known. We first give an
    algorithm for computing univariate GCD's which gives {\sl exact}
    results for interesting {\sl nearby} problems, and give efficient
    algorithms for computing precisely how nearby. We generalize this to
    multivariate GCD computations. Next, we adapt Lazard's $u$-resultant
    algorithm for the solution of overdetermined systems of polynomial
    equations to the inexact-coefficent case. We also briefly discuss an
    application of the modified Lazard's method to the location of
    singular points on approximately known projections of algebraic curves.",

    "It is shown that a good output for a solver of algebraic systems of
     dimension zero consists of a family of ``triangular sets of
     polynomials''. Such an output is simple, readable, and consists
     of all information which may be wanted.

     Different algorithms are described for handling triangular systems
     and obtaining them from Groebner bases. These algorithms are
     practicable, and most of them are polynomial in the number of
     solutions",
