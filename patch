  abstract = 
    "Computer algebra systems typically drop some degenerate cases when
    evaluating expressions, e.g. $x/x$ becomes 1 dropping the case
    $x=0$. We claim that it is feasible in practice to compute also the
    degenerate cases yielding {\sl guarded expressions}. We work over real
    closed fields but our ideas about handling guarded expressions can be
    easily transferred to other situations. Using formulas as guards
    provides a powerful tool for heuristically reducing the combinatorial
    explosion of cases: equivalent, redundant, tautological, and
    contradictive cases can be detected by simplification and quantifier
    elimination. Our approach allows to simplify the expressions on the
    basis of simplification knowledge on the logical side. The method
    described in this paper is implemented in the REDUCE package GUARDIAN,
    which is freely available on the WWW.",

  abstract =
    "Let A be a set of polynomials in r variables with integer
    coefficients. An $A$-invariant cylindrical algebraic decomposition 
    (cad) of $r$-dimensional Euclidean space (G. Collins, Lect. Notes 
    Comp. Sci., 33, Springer-Verlag, 1975, pp 134-183) is a certain 
    cellular decomposition of $r$-space, such that each cell is a 
    semi-algebraic set, the polynomials of $A$ are sign-invariant on 
    each cell, and the cells are arranged into cylinders. The cad 
    algorithm given by Collins provides, among other applications, 
    the fastest known decision procedure for real closed fields, a 
    cellular decomposition algorithm for semi-algebraic sets, and a 
    method of solving nonlinear (polynomial) optimization problems 
    exactly. The time-consuming calculations with real algebraic 
    numbers required by the algorithm have been an obstacle to its 
    implementation and use. The major contribution of this thesis 
    is a new version of the cad algorithm for $r \le 3$, in which 
    one works with maximal connected $A$-invariant collections of 
    cells, in such a way as to often avoid the most time-consuming 
    algebraic number calculations. Essential to this new cad 
    algorithm is an algorithm we present for determination of 
    adjacenies among the cells of a cad. Computer programs for 
    the cad and adjacency algorithms have been written, providing 
    the first complete implementation of a cad algorithm. Empirical 
    data obtained from application of these programs are presented 
    and analyzed."

           Algebraic Decomposition",

  abstract =
    "A fundamental algorithm pertaining to the solution of polynomial
    equations in several variables is the {\sl cylindrical algebraic
    decomposition (cad)} algorithm due to G.E. Collins. Given as input
    a set $A$ of integral polynomials in $r$ variables, the cad 
    algorithm produces a decomposition of the euclidean space of $r$
    dimensions into cells, such that each polynomial in $A$ is 
    invariant in sign throughout each of the cells in the decomposition.
    
    A key component of the cad algorithm is the projection operation:
    the {\sl projection} of a set $A$ of $r$-variate polynomials is
    defined to be a certain set $P$ of $(r-1)$-variate polynomials.
    The solution set, or variety, of the polynomials in $P$ comprises
    a projection in the geometric sense of the variety of $A$. The cad
    algorithm proceeds by forming successive projections of the input
    set $A$, each projection resulting in the elimination of one
    variable.
    
    This thesis is concerned with a refinement to the cad algorithm,
    and to its projection operation in particular. It is shown, using
    a theorem from real algebraic geometry, that the original 
    projection set that Collins used can be substantially reduced in
    size, without affecting its essential properties. The results of
    theoretical analysis and empirical observations suggest that the
    reduction in the projection set size leads to an overall decrease
    in the computing time of the cad algorithm.",
