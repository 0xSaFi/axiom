  abstract =
    "Typeclasses have proven an elegant and effective way of managing
    ad-hoc polymorphism in both programming languages and interactive
    proof assistants. However, the increasingly sophisticated uses of
    typeclasses within proof assistants has exposed two critical
    problems with existing typeclass resolution procedures: the 
    {\sl diamond problem} which causes exponential running times in
    both theory and practice, and the {\sl cycle problem}, which
    cuases loops in the presense of cycles and so thwarts many desired
    uses of typeclasses. We present a new typeclass resolution
    procedure, called {\sl tabled typeclass resolution}, that solve
    these problems. We have implemented our procedure for the upcoming
    version (v4) of the Lean Theorem Prover, and confirm empirically
    that it provides exponential speedups compared to all existing
    procedures in the presense of diamonds. Our procedure is
    sufficiently lightweight that it could easily be implemented in
    other systems. We hope our new procedure facilitates even more
    sophisticated uses of typeclasses in both software development and
    interactive theorem proving.",

    impressive systems have been developed to this end, such as

    (e.g., Java, C\#). We have been developing a programming language

    accompanying verifying compiler. In this paper, we present a
    technical overview of the verifying compiler and document the
    numerous design decisions made. Indeed, many of our designs
