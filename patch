    "This talk examines the history and future of symbolic mathematical
    computer systems. This talk will trace the development of three
    generations of computer algebra systems as typified by an early system
    of 60's: FORMAC, the standalone systems of the 70's: REDUCE and
    MACSYMA, and those developed in the 80's: muMATH, MAPLE, SMP, with
    particular emphasis on Scratchpad II, a system of revolutionary design
    currently under development by IBM Research.
    
    This talk will trace the progress of algebraic algorithm research in
    the past 25 years, advances in hardware and software technology over
    the same period, and the impact of such progress on the design issues
    of such systems. The talk will conclude with a description of the
    workstation of the future and its anticipated impact on the research
    and educational communities.",

    "The problem of factorising polynomials: that is to say, given a
    polynomial with integer coefficients, to find the irreducible
    polynomials that divide it, is one with a long history. While the last
    word has not been said on the subject, we can say that the past 15
    years have seen major break-throughs, and many computer algebra
    systems now include {\sl efficient} algorithms for this problem. When
    it comes to polynomials with algebraic number coefficients, the
    problem is far harder, and several major questions remain to be
    answered. Nevertheless, the last few years have seen substantial
    improvements, and such factorisations are now possible",

    "Groebner bases are certain finite sets of multivariate
    polynomials. Many problems in polynomial ideal theory (algebra
    geometry, non-linear computational geometry) can be solved by easy
    algorithms after transforming the polynomial sets involved in the
    specification of the problems into Groebner basis form. In this paper
    we give gome examples of applying the Groebner bases method to
    problems in non-linear computational geometry (inverse kinematics in
    robot programming, collision detection for superellipsoids,
    implicitization of parametric representations of curves and surfaces,
    inversion problem for parametric representations, automated
    geometrical theorem proving, primary decompsotion of implicitly
    defined geometrical objects). The paper starts with a brief summary of
    the Groebner bases method.",

    "Within the last few years, there have been numerous applications of
    computer algebra to special functions. G. Gasper (Norwestern
    University) has studied classical hypergeometric functions, and
    W. Gosper (Symbolics Inc.) has developed a large variety of
    spectacular transformation and summation techniques for MACSYMA. The
    purpose of this note is to explore some of the interface between
    computer algebra and special functions. In Section 2 we examine an
    application of MACSYMA which inadequately relied, in my opinion, on
    what was readily available in the literature on hypergeometric
    series. In Section 3 we consider classical observations on sums of
    powers of binomial coefficients. In Section 4 we consider a problem of
    D.M. Jackson wherein SCRATCHPAD and classical hypergeometric series
    interact nicely. We close with a problem inspired by work in
    statistical mechanics which leads us to questions about algorithms
    that would be useful in computer algebra applications.",
