    "One of the most controversial and least well defined of mathematical
    problems is the problem of simplification.  The recent upsurge
    of interest in mechanized mathematics has lent new urgency to this
    problem, but so far very little has been accomplished.  This paper
    attempts to shed light on the situation by introducing the class of
    rational exponential expressions, defining simplification within
    this class, and showing constructively how to achieve it. It is shown
    that the only simplified rational exponential expression equivalent to
    0 is 0 itself, provided that an easily stated conjecture is true.
    However the conjecture, if true, will surely be difficult to prove,
    since it asserts as a special case that $\pi$ and $e$ are algebraically
    independent, and no one has yet been able to prove even the much
    weaker conjecture that $\pi+e$ is irrational.",

  abstract =
    "The ML family of languages and LCF-style interactive theorem proving
    have been closely related from their beginnings about 30 years
    ago. Here we report on a recent project to adapt both the Poly/ML
    compiler and the Isabelle theorem prover to current multicore
    hardware. Checking theories and proofs in typical Isabelle application
    takes minutes or hours, and users expect to make efficient use of
    ``home machines'' with 2-8 cores, or more.
    
    Poly/ML and Isabelle are big and complex software systems that have
    evolved over more than two decades. Faced with the requirement to
    deliver a stable and efficient parallel programming environment, many
    infrastructure layers had to be reworked: from low-level system
    threads to high-level principles of value-oriented programming. At
    each stage we carefully selected from the many existing concepts for
    parallelism, and integrated them in a way that fits smoothly into the
    idea of purely functional ML with the addition of synchronous
    exceptions and asynchronous interrupts.
    
    From the Isabelle/ML perspective, the main concept to manage parallel
    evaluation is that of ``future values''. Scheduling is implicit, but it
    is also possible to specify dependencies and priorities. In addition,
    block-structured groups of futures with propagation of exceptions
    allow for alternative functional evaluation (such as parallel search),
    without requiring user code to tackle concurrency. Our library also
    provides the usual parallel combinators for functions on lists, and
    analogous versions on prover tactics.
    
    Despite substantial reorganization in the background, only minimal
    changes are occasionally required in user ML code, and none at the
    Isabelle application level (where parallel theory and proof processing
    is fully implicit). The present implementation is able to address more
    than 8 cores effectively, while the earlier version of the official
    Isabelle2009 release works best for 2-4 cores. Scalability beyond 16
    cores still poses some extra challenges, and will require further
    improvements of the Poly/ML runtime system (heap management and
    garbage collection), and additional parallelization of Isabelle
    application logic.",

  abstract =
    "We discuss the problem of incorporating into a heuristic theorem
    prover a decision procedure for a fragment of the logic.  An obvious
    goal when incorporating such a procedure is to reduce the search space
    explored by the heuristic component of the system, as would be
    achieved by eliminating from the system’s data base some explicitly
    stated axioms.  For example, if a decision procedure for linear
    inequalities is added, one would hope to eliminate the explicit
    consideration of the transitivity axioms.  However, the decision
    procedure must then be used in all the ways the eliminated axioms
    might have been.  The difficulty of achieving this degree of
    integration is more dependent upon the complexity of the heuristic
    component than upon that of the decision procedure.  The view of the
    decision procedure as a ``black box'' is frequently destroyed by the
    need pass large amounts of search strategic information back and forth
    between the two components.  Finally, the efficiency of the decision
    procedure may be virtually irrelevant; the efficiency of the final
    system may depend most heavily on how easy it is to communicate
    between the two components.  This paper is a case study of how we
    integrated a linear arithmetic procedure into a heuristic theorem
    prover.  By linear arithmetic here we mean the decidable subset of
    number theory dealing with universally quantified formulas composed of
    the logical connectives, the identity relation, the Peano ``less than''
    relation, the Peano addition and subtraction functions, Peano
    constants, and variables taking on natural values.  We describe our
    system as it originally stood, and then describe chronologically the
    evolution of our linear arithmetic procedure and its interface to the
    heuristic theorem prover.  We also provide a detailed description of
    our final linear arithmetic procedure and the use we make of it.  This
    description graphically illustrates the difference between a
    stand-alone decision procedure and one that is of use to a more
    powerful theorem prover.",
