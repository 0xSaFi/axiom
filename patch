    "The 'more' in the title is because this paper is a sequel to papers
    by Keving Broughan, [BKRRD,BK]. For some years GK has had interests in
    (i) interactive front-ends to numeric computation, such as the
    NAG/IMSL library computation, and (ii) Fortran code generation for
    Argument SubPrograms (ASPs), such as those neede by some NAG/IMSL
    routines. Demonstrations of three links to the NAG library are
    described in [BKRRD]. A description of a link to NAG from Macsyma
    which was mentioned, but not in a sufficiently advanced state to
    demonstrate in early 1991, is given in [BK]. The situation at the end
    of 1991 was that there were links to NAG involving each of Macsyma,
    REDUCE and Mathematica. The links are called Naglink, IRENA and
    InterCall, respectively. The principal authors of IRENA are Mike Dewar
    and Mike Richardson. InterCall is not specific to the NAG library;
    indeed InterCall is used with calls to IMSL and to elsewhere at the
    conference venue, the University of New Mexico.
    
    The two futher links to NAG library treated in this paper are AXIOM2.0
    and genmex/ESC, genmex allows calls to NAG from Matlab. genmex can be
    regarded as similar to InterCall: genmes uses Matlab's mex files in a
    similar way to InterCall's use of Mathematica's MathLink. Again genmex
    is not specific to the NAG library. Mike Dewar is an author both of
    IRENA and the AXIOM2.0 link to the NAG library: see [D] foe discussion
    of the differences between the IRENA project and the AXIOM-NAG link
    project."

"One of the long-term general goals of algebraic manipulation systems
has been the automation of difficult or tedious, yet common, symbolic
mathematical operations. Prominent amount these has been symbolic
integration. Although some effective algorithms have been devised for
integration expecially for those problems solvable in terms of
elementary functions and a few additional special functions, the vast
majority of entires in large tables of indefinite and definite
integrals remain out of reach of current machine algorithms. We
propose techniques for introducing the information in such tables to
computers, extending such tables, and measuring the success of such
automation.

Similar tabular data concerning simplifications, summation identities,
and similar formulas could also be treated by some of the same
techniques."

    "One of the basic techniques in every mathematician's toolkit is the
    Taylor series representation of functions. It is of such fundamental
    importance and it is so well understood that its use is often a first
    choice in numerical analysis. This faith has not, unfortunately, been
    transferred to the design of computer algorithms.
    
    Approximation by use of Taylor series methods is inherently partly a
    symbolic process and partly numeric> This aspect has often, with
    reason, been regared as a major hindrance in algorithm design. Whilst
    attempts have been made in the past to build a consistent set of
    programs for the symbolic and numeric paradigms, these have been
    necessarily multi-stage processes.
    
    Using current technology it has at last become possible to integrate
    these two concepts and build an automatic adaptive symbolic-numeric
    algorithm within a uniform framework which can hide the internal
    workings behind a modern interface."

    "A new finite difference method for the Helmholtz equation is
    presented. The method involves replacing the standard ``weights'' in the
    central difference quotients (Secs. 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3) by weights that
    are optimal in a sense that will be explained in the sections just
    mentioned. The calculation of the optimal weights involves some
    complicated and error-prone manipulations of integral formulas that is
    best done using computer-aided symbolic computation (SC). In addition,
    we discuss the important problem of interpolation involving meshes
    that have been refined in certain subregions. Analytic formulae are
    derived using SC for these interpolation schemes. Our results are
    discussed in Sec. 5. Some hints about the computer methods we used to
    accomplish these results are given in the Appendix. More information
    is available and access to that information is referenced.
    
    While we do not want to make SC the focus of this work, we also do not
    want to underestimate its value. Armed with robust and efficient SC
    libraries, a researcher can {\sl comfortably} and {\sl conveniently}
    experiment with ideas that he or she might not examine otherwise."
