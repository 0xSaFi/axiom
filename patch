    "We present the design and testing of an algorithm for iterative
    refinement of the solution of linear equations, were the residual is
    computed with extra precision. This algorithm was originally proposed
    in the 1960s as a means to compute very accurate solutions to all but
    the most ill-conditioned linear systems of equations. However two
    obstacles hae until now prevented its adoption in standard subroutine
    libraries like LAPACK: (1) There was no standard way to access the
    higher precision arithmetic needed to compute residuals, and (2) it
    was unclear how to compute a reliable error bound for the computed
    solution. The completion of the new BLAS Technical Forum Standard has
    recently removed the first obstacle. To overcome the second obstacle,
    we show how a single application of iterative refindment can be used
    to copute an error bound in any norm at small cost, and use this to
    compute both an error bound in the usual infinity norm, and a
    componentwise relative error bound.

    We report extensive test results on over 6.2 million matrices of
    dimension 5, 10, 100, and 1000. As long as a normwise
    (resp. componentwise) condition number computed by the algorithm is
    less than $1/max(10,\sqrt{n})\epsilon_w$, the computed normwise
    (resp. componentwise) error bound is at most
    $2max(10,\sqrt{n})\epsilon_w$, and indeed bounds the true error. Here,
    $n$ is the matrix dimension and $\epsilon_w$ is a single precision
    roundoff error. For worse conditioned problems, we get similarly small
    correct error bounds in over 89.4\% of cases."
