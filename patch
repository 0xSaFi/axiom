    "The object of the paper is to prove that the differential equation
    \[u^{'}(t)=t-[u(t)]^2\] 
    has no solutions which can be written using elementary functions, or
    anti-derivatives of elementary functions, or exponentials of such
    anti-derivatives, or anti-derivative of those, etc. We should note
    that Equation 1 can be solved using power series, integrals which
    depend on a parameter, or Bessel functions of order $1/3$.  However,
    as we will see, none of these methods of solution are ``algebraic'' in
    nature.

    We aim to give a precise definition of ``algebraic'' by developing the
    theory of {\sl differential algebra}, which is largely the work of
    Ritt. Other contributors are Liouville, Picard, Vessoit, Kolchin,
    Rosenlicht, ... The part of differential Galois theory which leads to
    a proof of Abel's celebrated result that a general polynomial equation
    of degree five or higher cannot be solved by radicals. In effort to
    derive these two areas in parallel, we will also explain why the
    polynomial equation
    \[x^5-4x^2-2=0\]
    has no solutions which can be written as radicals of solutions to
    lower degree polyomial equations."
