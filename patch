    "This course will be mainly mathematics, some computer science
    and a little computing. Little or no essential use will be made of
    actual computer languages, although I may occasionally use Pascal, C,
    Lisp or REDUCE for concrete examples. The aim of the course is to
    provide an entry into the current research literature, but not to present
    the most recent research results.
    
    The first half of the course (taught by me) will deal with basic math-
    ematics and algorithms for computer algebra, primarily at the level of
    arithmetic and elementary abstract algebra, including an introduction
    to GCDs and the solution of univariate polynomial equations. This
    leads into the second half of the course (taught by Dr Jim Skea) on
    the more advanced problems of polynomial factorization, indefinite in-
    tegration, multivariate polynomial equations, etc.
    
    The first week provides an introduction to the computing aspects
    of computer algebra, and contains almost no mathematics. It is in-
    tended to show how the later theory can be implemented for practical
    computation. The second week provides a rapid but superficial survey
    of the abstract algebra that is most important for computer algebra.
    The next five weeks will build on this abstract basis to do some more
    concrete mathematics in more details, referring back to the basis es-
    tablished in the first two weeks as necessary.
    
    At the end of each set of notes will be exercises, one (or more) of
    which will be assessed.",

  abstract = 
    "Two earlier papers described the generalizations of Euclid's
    algorithm to deal with the problem of computing the greatest common
    divisor (GCD) or the resultant of a pair of polynomials. A sequal to
    those two papers is presented here.
    
    In attempting such a generalization one easily arrives at the concept
    of a polynomial remainder sequence (PRS) and then quickly discovers
    the phenomenon of explosive coefficient growth.  Fortunately, this
    explosive growth is not inherent in the problem, but is only an
    artifact of various naive solutions. If one removes the content (that
    is, the GCD of the coefficients) from each polynomial in a PRS, the
    coefficient growth in the resulting primitive PRS is relatively modest.
    However, the cost of computing the content (by applying Euclid's
    algorithm in the coefficient domain) may be unacceptably or even
    prohibitively high, especially if the coefficients are themselves
    polynomials in one or more addltional variables.
    
    The key to controlling coefficient growth without the costly
    computation of GCD's of coefficients is the fundamental theorem of
    subresuitants, which shows that every polynomial in a PRS is
    proportional to some subresultant of the first two.  By arranging for
    the constants of proportionahty to be unity, one obtains the
    subresultant PRS algorithm, in which the coefficient growth is
    essentially linear.  A corollary of the fundamental theorem is given
    here, which leads to a simple derivation and deeper understanding of
    the subresultant PRS algorithm and converts a conjecture mentioned in
    the earlier papers into an elementary remark.
    
    A possible alternative method of constructing a subresultant PRS is to
    evaluate all the subresultants directly from Sylvester's determinant
    via expansion by minors. A complexity analysis is given in conclusion,
    along lines pioneered by Gentleman and Johnson, showing that the
    subresultant PRS algorithm is superior to the determinant method
    whenever the given polynomials are sufficiently large and dense, but
    is inferior in the sparse extreme.",

    results, while interesting in themselves, also serve to display two
    points: (1) Asymptotic results are sometimes misleading for noninfinite
    (e.g.  practical) problems.  (2) Models of computation are by
    definition simplifications of reality: algorithmic analysis should be
    carried out under several distinct computatmnal models and should be

    Geddes/Czapor/Labahn) take a rather simple view from the algebraic
    manipulation standpoint. As will be apparent shortly, we relate the
    FFT to the evaluation of a polynomial. We also consider it of interest
    primarily as an algorithm in a discrete (finite) computation structure
