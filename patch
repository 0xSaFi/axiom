   "OpenDreamKit will deliver a flexible toolkit enabling research groups
    to set up Virtual Research Environments, customised to meet the varied
    needs of research projects in pure mathematics and applications, and
    supporting the full research life-cycle from exploration, through
    proof and publication, to archival and sharing of data and code.

    OpenDreamKit will be built out of a sustainable ecosystem of
    community-developed open software, databases, and ser- vices,
    including popular tools such as LINBOX, MPIR, SAGE (sagemath.org),
    GAP, PARI/GP, LMFDB, and SINGULAR. We will extend the JUPYTER Notebook
    environment to provide a flexible user interface. By improving and
    unifying existing build- ing blocks, OpenDreamKit will maximise both
    sustainability and impact, with beneficiaries extending to scientific
    computing, physics, chemistry, biology and more, and including
    researchers, teachers, and industrial practitioners.

    We will define a novel component-based VRE architecture and adapt
    existing mathematical software, databases, and user interface
    components to work well within it on varied platforms. Interfaces to
    standard HPC and grid services will be built in. Our architecture will
    be informed by recent research into the sociology of mathematical
    collaboration, so as to properly support actual research practice. The
    ease of set up, adaptability and global impact will be demonstrated in
    a variety of demonstrator VREs.

    We will ourselves study the social challenges associated with
    large-scale open source code development and publications based on
    executable documents, to ensure sustainability.

    OpenDreamKit will be conducted by a Europe-wide steered by demand
    collaboration, including leading mathematicians, computational
    researchers, and software developers with a long track record of
    delivering innovative open source software solutions for their
    respective communities. All produced code and tools will be open
    source."
