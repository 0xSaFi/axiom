    "In this paper, we give a natural way of deciding whether a given
    cyclic code contains a word of given weight. The method is based on
    the manipulation of the locators and of the locator polynomial of a
    codeword $x$.
    
    Because of the dimensions of the problem, we need to use a symbolic
    computation software, like Maple or Scratchpad II. The method can be
    ineffective when the length is too large.
    
    The paper contains two parts: In the first part we will present the main
    definitions and properties we need.
    
    In the second part, we will explain how to use these properties, and, as
    illustration, we will prove the following facts:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The dual of the BCH code of length 63 and designed distance 9
    has true minimum distance 14 (which was already known).
    \item The BCH code of length 1023 and designed distance of 253 has
    minimum distance 253.
    \item The cyclic codes of length $2^11-1$, $2^13-1$, $2^17-1$, with
    generator polynomial $m_1(x)$ and $m_7(x)$ have minimum distance 4.
    \end{itemize}"

    "The purpose of this paper is to review an algorithm for computing
    ``small'' resolutions in homological algebra, to provide examples of
    its use as promised in [L1], [LS], and to illustrate the use of
    computer algebra in an area not usually associated with that
    subject. Comparison of the complexes produced by the method discussed
    here with those produced by other methods shows that the algorithm
    generalizes several other approaches, [GL], [GLS1], [GLS2], [BL], [BL2].  
    
    This is an expository note which is intended to help make homological
    perturbation theory more accesible and to encourage wider use of
    Computer Algebra in mathematical research.
    
    The class of objects presented here -- Finitely generated torsion-free
    nilpotent groups (of arbitrary nilpotency class) -- are given because
    of their simplicity. The examples point to the general phenomena that
    are to be expected when trying to derive complexes smaller than
    ``standard complexes'' in other homological contexts. The complexes
    produced are generally {\sl much} smaller than the bar construction, but
    larger than a {\sl minimal resolution}."

    symbolic computations with a particular class of algebraic formulas in
    a numerical code. Developing and implementing such algorithms in a
    numerical programming language is a tedious and error prone task. The
    algorithms can be developed in a computer algebra system and their
    correctness can be checked by comparison with built-in facilities of
    the system so that the system is used as an advanced debugging
    tool. After that a numerical code for the algorithms is automatically
    generated from the same source code. The proposed methodolgy is
    explained in detail on a simple example. Real applications to
    calculation of matrix elements of Coulomb interaction and two-centre
    exchange integrals needed in atomic collision codes, are
    described. The method makes the developing and debugging of such
    algorithms easier and faster."
