    "We show that the problem of partial type inference in the $n$-th
    order polymorphic $\lambda$-calculus is equivalent to $n$-th order
    unification. On the one hand, this means that partial type inference
    in polymorphic $\lambda$-calculi of order 2 or higher is
    undecidable. On the other hand, higher-order unification is often
    tractable in practice, and our translation entails a very useful
    algorithm for partial type inference in the $omega$-order polymorphic
    $\lambda$-calculus. We present an implementation in $\lambda$Prolog in
    full.",

    "Briefly, this book is about an approach to bringing software
    engineering up to speed with more traditional engineering disciplines,
    providing a mathematical foundation for rigorous analysis of realistic
    computer systems. As civil engineers apply their mathematical canon to
    reach high certainty that bridges will not fall down, the software
    engineer should apply a different canon to argue that programs behave
    properly. As other engineering disciplines have their computer-aided
    design tools, computer science has proof assistants, IDEs for logical
    arguments. We will learn how to apply these tools to certify that
    programs behave as expected.
    
    More specifically: Introductions to two intertangled subjects: the Coq
    proof assistant, a tool for machine-checked mathematical theorem
    proving; and formal logical reasoning about the correctness of
    programs.",

    onbetrouwbaarheid der logische principes' (The unreliability of the
    logical principles) of 1908, together with a philosophical and
    historical introduction. In this paper Brouwer for the first time
    objected to the idea that the Principle of the Excluded Middle is
    valid. We discuss the circumstances under which the manuscript was
    submitted and accepted, Brouwer's ideas on the principle of the
    excluded middle, and its consistency and partial validity, and his
    argument against the possibility of absolutely undecidable
    propositions. We not that principled objections to the general
    exculded middle similar to Brouwer's had been advanced in print by
    Jules Molk two years before. Finally, we discuss the influence on
    George Griss' negationless mathematics",
