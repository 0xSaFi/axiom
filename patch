    "Many ambitious computer algebra systems were initially designed in a
    flush of enthusiasm, with the goal of automating any symbolic
    mathematical manipulation ``correctly''. Historically, this approach
    results in programs that implicitly used certain identities to
    simplify expressions. These identities, which very likely seemed
    universally true to the programmers in the heat of writing the CAS
    (and often were true in well-known abstract algebraic domains) later
    neede re-examination when such systems were extended for dealing with
    kinds of objects unanticipated in the original design. These new
    objects are generally introduced to the CAS by extending
    ``generically'' the arithmetic of other operations. For example,
    approximate floats do not have the mathematical properties of exact
    integers or rationals. Complex numbers may strain a system designed
    for real-valued variables. In the situation examined here, we consider
    two categories of ``extended'' numbers: $\infty$ and {\sl undefined},
    and real intervals. We comment on issues raised by these two
    troublesome notions, how their introduction into a computer algebra
    system may require a (sometimes painful) reconsideration and redesign
    of parts of the program, and how they are related. An alternative
    (followed most notably by the Axiom system is to essentially envision
    a ``meta'' CAS defined in terms of categories and inheritance with
    only the most fundamental built-in concepts; from these one can build
    many variants of specific CAS features. This approach is appealing but
    can fail to accommodate extensions that violate some mathematical
    tenets in the cause of practicality."
