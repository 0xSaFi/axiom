Goal: Axiom Maintenance

The fundamental purpose of scientific discourse is not the mere presentation
of information and thought, but rather its actual communication.
-- George Gopen and Judith Swan

Literate programming ... because yourself from the past does not answer emails.

...design of systems of computer algebra not getting the recognition
they deserve in terms of the object-oriented community. I should say

I think that that's the big contribution of computer algebra --
making the knowledge of lots of mathematicins that worked for a
long time but have put all their results in journals that are
very difficult to extract and to find, putting it at the fingertips
of everybody. I think that that's one of the most important contributions.
-- Gaston Gonnet [Gonn05]
