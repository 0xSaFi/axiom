    "We have discovered a new implementaiton of the qd algorithm that has
    a far wider domain of stability than Rutishauser's version. Our
    algorithm was developed from an examination of the LR-Cholesky
    transformation and can be adapted to parallel computation in stark
    contrast to traditional qd. Our algorithm also yields useful a
    posteriori upper and lower bounds on the smallest singular value of a
    bidiagonal matrix.

    The zero-shift bidiagonal QR of Demmel and Kahan computes the smallest
    singlar values to maximal relative accuracy and the others to maximal
    absolute accuracy with little or no degradation in efficiency when
    compared with the LINPACK code. Our algorithm obtains maximal relative
    accuracy for all the singluar values and runs at least four times
    faster than the LINPACK code."
