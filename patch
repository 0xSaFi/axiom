    package for the Macintosh. Many interesting and instructive things can

    dimensional plots that can be very instructive in examining the

    "The development of polynomial-elimination techniques from classical
    theory to modern algorithms has undergone a tortuous and rugged
    path. This can be observed L. van der Waerden's elimination of the
    ``elimination theory'' chapter from from B. his classic Modern Algebra
    in later editions, A. Weil's hope to eliminate ``from algebraic
    geometry the last traces of elimination theory,'' and S. Abhyankar's
    suggestion to ``eliminate the eliminators of elimination theory.''
    The renaissance and recognition of polynomial elimination owe much to
    the advent and advance of modern computing technology, based on
    which effective algorithms are implemented and applied to diverse
    problems in science and engineering. In the last decade, both
    theorists and practitioners have more and more realized the
    significance and power of elimination methods and their underlying
    theories. Active and extensive research has contributed a great deal
    of new developments on algorithms and softÂ­ ware tools to the subject,
    that have been widely acknowledged. Their applications have taken
    place from pure and applied mathematics to geometric modeling and
    robotics, and to artificial neural networks. This book provides a
    systematic and uniform treatment of elimination algorithms that
    compute various zero decompositions for systems of multivariate 
    polynomials. The central concepts are triangular sets and systems of
    different kinds, in terms of which the decompositions are
    represented. The prerequisites for the concepts and algorithms are
    results from basic algebra and some knowledge of algorithmic
    mathematics."

    In his algorithm for the integration of algebraic functions, Trager
    describes a Hermite-type reduction to reduce the problem to an
    integrand with only simple finite poles on the associated Riemann
    surface. We generalize that technique to curves over liouvillian
    ground fields, and use it to simplify our integrands.  Once the
    multipe finite poles have been removed, we use the Puiseux expansions
    of the integrand at infinity and a generalization of the residues to
    compute the integral. We also generalize a result of Rothstein that
    gives us a necessary condition for elementary integrability, and
