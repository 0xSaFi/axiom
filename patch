    We present an efficient algorithm for the transformation of a
    Grobner basis of a zero-dimensional ideal with respect to any given
    ordering into a Grobner basis with respect to any other
    ordering. This algorithm is polynomial in the degree of the idea. In
    particular, the lexicographical Grobner basis can be obtained by
    applying this algorithm after a total degree Grobner basis
    computation: it is usually much faster to compute the basis this way
    than with a direct application of Buchberger's algorithm."
