    time (JIT) compilers. The tractability of our approach is demonstrated
    through, what we believe is the first, verification of a JIT
    compiler with respect to a realistic semantics of self-modifying x86
    machine code. Our semantics includes a model of the instruction
    cache. Two versions of the verified JIT compiler are presented: one
    generates all of the machine code at once, the other one is incremental
    i.e. produces code on-demand. All proofs have been performed
    inside the HOL4 theorem prover.",

    tional programming language running on commercial processors. Inter-
    preters for the core of McCarthyâ€™s LISP 1.5 were implemented in ARM,
    x86 and PowerPC machine code, and proved to correctly parse, evaluate
    and print LISP s-expressions. The proof of evaluation required working
    on top of verified implementations of memory allocation and garbage
    collection. All proofs are mechanised in the HOL4 theorem prover.",

    "This paper presents a compiler which produces machine code from
    functions defined in the logic of a theorem prover, and at the same
    time proves that the generated code executes the source functions.
    Unlike previously published work on proof-producing compilation from a
    theorem prover, our compiler provides broad support for user-defined
    extensions, targets multiple carefully modelled commercial machine
    lan- guages, and does not require termination proofs for input
    functions. As a case study, the compiler is used to construct verified
    interpreters for a small LISP-like language. The compiler has been
    implemented in the HOL4 theorem prover.",
