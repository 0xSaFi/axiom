    "The authors consider a problem coming from the theory of discrete
    dynamical systems (iterations of diffeomorphisms in
    $\mathbb{R}^3$). Namely, how to characterize the behaviour of the
    trajectories near the fixed points and the stability of this behaviour
    under perturbations. The authors use the computer in the context of
    reversible mappings. When such a mapping has some degree of degeneracy
    they apply Gr√∂bner bases techniques and the theory of (formal) normal
    forms in the space of the coefficients of the jets of the
    mapping. They show that a language with typed objects like AXIOM is
    very convenient to solve such problems."

    "Spencer cohomology is one of the classical tools in the study of
    overdetermined systems of partial differential equations. The paper
    proposes a new point of view of the Spencer cohomology based on a dual
    approach via comodules that allows to relate the Spencer cohomology to
    standard constructions in homological algebra, and discuss concrete
    methods for its construction based on homological perturbation
    theory. It also gives a detailed introduction to the subject, and
    proposes a new algorithm of constructing the Spencer resolution by
    using symbolic computation systems."
