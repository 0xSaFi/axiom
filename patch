    "A new method, called the QZ algorithm, is presented for the solution
    of the matrix eigenvalue problem $Ax=\lambda{}Bx$ with general square
    matrices $A$ and $B$. Particluar attention is paid to the degeracies
    which result when $B$ is singular. No inversions of $B$ or its
    submatrices are used. The algorithm is a generalization of the QR
    algorithm, and reduces to it when $B=I$. A Fortran program and some
    illustrative examples are included."
