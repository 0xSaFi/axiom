    "In this paper an attempt is made to explore the logical foundations
    of computer programming by use of techniques which were first applied
    in the study of geometry and have later been extended to other branches
    of mathematics. This involves the elucidation of sets of axioms and
    rules of inference which can be used in proofs of the properties of
    computer programs. Examples are given of such axioms and rules, and
    a formal proof of a simple theorem is displayed. Finally, it is argued
    that important advantages, both theoretical and practical, may follow
    from a pursuance of these topics",

    "We present Zenon, an automated theorem prover for first order
    classical logic (with equality), based on the tableau method. Zenon is
    intended to be the dedicated prover of the Focal environment, an
    object-oriented algebraic specification and proof system, which is
    able to produce OCaml code for execution and Coq code for
    certification. Zenon can directly generate Coq proofs (proof scripts
    or proof terms), which can be reinserted in the Coq specifications
    produced by Focal. Zenon can also be extended, which makes specific
    (and possibly local) automation possible in Focal.",

    "Type Classes have met a large success in Haskell and Isabelle, as a
    solution for sharing notations by overloading and for specifying with
    abstract structures by quantificaiton on contexts. However, both
    systems are limited by second-class implementations of these
    constructs, and these limitations are only overcome by ad-hoc
    extensions to the respective systems. We propose an embedding of type
    classes into a dependent type theory that is first-class and supports
    some of the most popular extensions right away. The implementation is
    correspondingly cheap, general, and integrates well inside the system,
    as we have experimented in Coq. We show how it can be used to help
    structured programming and proving by way of examples.",
