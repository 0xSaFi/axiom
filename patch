    equational logic in computer science, for example in the study of
    abstract data types, are not sound. Correcting these rules by
    introducing explicit quantifiers yields a system which, although it is
    sound, is not complete; some new rules are needed for the addition and
    deletion of quantifiers. This note is intended as an informal, but
    precise, introduction to the main issues and results. It gives an
    example showing the unsoundness of the usual rules; it also gives a
    completeness theorem for our new rules, and gives necessary and
    sufficient conditions for the old rules to agree with the new.",

    term reductions we present sufficient ``local'' conditions for the
    completeness and consistency of enrichment steps, which can be
    efficiently verified in many cases where other attempts to prove the
    enrichment property ``syntactically'' have failed so far."
