   "The Lambert W function is defined to be the multivalued inverse of
    the function $w \rightArrow we^w$. It has many applications in pure
    and applied mathematics, some of which are briefly described here.  We
    present a new discussion of the complex branches of $W$, an asymptotic
    expansion valid for all branches, an efficient numerical procedure for
    evaluating the function to arbitrary precision, and a method for the
    symbolic integration of expressions containing $W$."
