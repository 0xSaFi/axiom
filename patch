    "The paper (first written in 1969 and circulated privately) concerns
    the definition, axiomatization, and applications of the hereditarily
    monotone and continuous functionals generated from the integers and
    the Booleans (plus “undefined” elements). The system is formulated as
    a typed system of combinators (or as a typed λ-calculus) with a
    recursion operator (the least fixed-point operator), and its proof
    rules are contrasted to a certain extent with those of the untyped
    λ-calculus. For publication (1993), a new preface has been added, and
    many bibliographical references and comments in footnotes have been
    appended.",

    "The Knuth-Bendix completion procedure for rewrite rule systems is
    of wide applicability in symbolic and algebraic computation. 
    Attempts to reduce the complexity of this completion algorithm are
    reported in the literature. Already in their seminal 1967 paper
    D.E. Knuth and P.B. Bendix have suggested to keep all the rules
    iterreduced during the execution of the algorithm. G. Huet has
    presented a version of the completion algorithm in which every
    rewrite rule is kept in reduced form with respect to all the other
    rules in the system. Borrowing an idea of Buchberger's for the
    completion of bases of polynomial ideals the author has proposed
    in 1983 a criterion for detecting ``unnecessary'' critical
    pairs. If a critical pair is recognized as unnecessary then one
    need not apply the costly process of computing normal forms to
    it. It has been unclear whether these approaches can be
    combined. We demonstrate that it is possible to keep all the
    rewrite rules interreduced and still use a criterion for
    eliminating unnecessary critical pairs.",
