    "We describe the Univerity of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, a large
    and actively growing set of sparse matrices that arise in real
    applications. The Collection is widely used by the numerical linear
    algebra community for the development and performance evaluation of
    sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable
    experiments: robust because performance results with artificially
    generated matrices can be misleading, and repeatable because matrices
    are curated and made publicly available in many formats. Its matrices
    cover a wide spectrum of domains, including those arising from
    problems with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural engineering,
    computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics,
    semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer
    graphics/vision, robitics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and
    those that typically do not have such geometry (optimization, circuit
    simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum
    chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics,
    power networks, and other networks and graphs). We provide software
    for accessing and managing the Collection, from MATLAB, Mathematica,
    Fortran, and C, as well as an online search capability. Graph
    visualization of the matrices is provided, and a new multilevel
    coarsening scheme is proposed to facilitate this task."
