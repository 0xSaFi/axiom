    "SCRATCHPAD is a very large computer-algebra system implemented by the
    IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. It is available there on an IBM
    370, and it is available from other IBM corporate sites via
    telephone. Regrettably, this fine system has not yet been released to
    the public, but it is discussed here because of its novel features.
    
    In its entirety, the system occupies about 1600K bytes on an IBM 370
    with virtual storage, for which an additional minimum of 100 K bytes
    is recommeded for workspace. The variety of built-in transformations
    currently lies between that of REDUCE and MACSYMA. However, each of
    the three systems has features that none of the others possess, and
    one of these features may be a decisive advantage for a particular
    application. Here are some highlights of the SCRATCHPAD system:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The system provides single-precision floating-point arithmetic
    as well as indefinite-precision rational arithmetic
    \item The built-in unavoidable and optional algebraic transformations
    are approximately similar to those of MACSYMA.
    \item The built-in exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric
    transformations are approximately similar to those of REDUCE.
    \item Besides built-in symbolic matrix algebra, APL like array
    operations are included, and they are even further generalized to
    permit symbolic operations of nonhomogeneous arrays and on arrays
    of indefinite or infinite size.
    \item Symbolic differentiation and integration are built-in, with
    the latter employing the powerful Risch-Normal algorithm.
    \item There is a particularly elegant built-in facility for
    determining Taylor series expansions.
    \item There is a built-in SOLVE function capable of determining the
    exact solution to a system of linear equations.
    \item There is a powerful pattern-matching facility which serves as
    the primary mechanism for user level extensions. The associated syntax
    is at a very high level, being the closest of all computer algebra
    systems to the declarative, nonprocedural notation of mathematics.
    To implement the trigonometric multiple-angle expansions, we can
    merely enter the rewrite rules:
    \[cos(n*x) == 2*cos(x)*cos((n-1)*x)-cos((n-2)*x), n{\rm\ in\ }
    (2,3,...), x{\rm\ arb}\]
    \[sin(n*x) == 2*cos(x)*sin((n-1)*x)-sin((n-2)*x), n{\rm\ in\ }
    (2,3,...),x{\rm\ arb}\]
    Then, whenever we subsequently enter an expression such as 
    $cos(4*b)$, the response will be a corresponding expanded
    expression such as
    \[8*cos(B) - 8*cos^2(B)+1\]
    Thus, programs resemble a collection of math formulae, much as they
    would appear in a book or article.
    \item SCRATCHPAD has a particularly powerful yet easily used mechanism
    for controlling the output format of expressions.. For example, the user
    can specify that an expression be displayed as a power series in x,
    with coefficients which are factored rational functions in b and c,
    etc. For large expressions, such fine control over the output may
    mean the difference between an important new discovery and an
    inconprehensible mess.
    \end{itemize}
    
    This generalized recursive format idea is so natural and effective
    that SCRATCHPAD is now absorbing the idea into an internal 
    representation. A study of the polynomial additional algorithm in
    the previous section reveals that it is written to be applicable
    to any coefficient domain which has the algebraic properties of a
    {\sl ring}. The coefficients could be matrices, power-series, etc.
    That coefficient domain could in turn have yet another coefficient
    domain, and so on. With a careful modular design, packages to treat
    each of these domains can be dynamically linked together so that
    code can be shared and combined in new ways without extensive
    rewriting and duplication. Then not only the output, but also the
    internal computations can be selected most suitably for a particular
    application.
