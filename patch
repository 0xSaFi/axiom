  abstract = 
    "Computing the singular values of a bidiagonal matrix is the final
    phase of the standard algorithm for the singular value decomposition
    of a general matrix. We present a new algorithm which computes all the
    singular values of a bidiagonal matrix to high relative accuracy
    independent of their magnitudes. In contrast, the standard algorithm
    for bidiagonal matrices may compute small singular values with no
    relative accuracy at all. Numerical experiments show that the new
    algorithm is comparable in speed to the standard algorithm, and
    frequently faster. We also show how to accurately compute tiny
    eigenvalues of some classes of symmetric trigiagonal matrices using
    the same technique."
