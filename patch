    the result. This algorithm is not yet implemented; thus technical
    details and proofs are omitted, for emphasising on the relation
    between the algorithm design and a good representation of the
    result. The algorithm is based on a new theorem of decomposition for

  abstract =
    "Some methods for polynomial system solving require efficient
    techniques for computing univariate polynomial gcd over algebraic
    extensions of a field. Currently used techniques compute {\sl generic}
    univariate polynomial gcd before {\sl specializing} the result using
    algebraic relations in the ring of coefficients. This strategy
    generates very big intermediate data and fails for many problems. We
    present here a new approach which takes permanently into account those
    algebraic relations. It is based on a property of subresultant
    remainder sequences and leads to a great increase of the speed of
    computations and thus the size of accessible systems."

  abstract = 
    "This thesis is dedicated to polynomial system solving by means of
    triangular sets. A first prt presents two algorithms to compute
    polynomial gcds over tower of simple extensions. The first one was
    designed by Renaud Rioboo and applies to algebraic towers. The second
    one is a generalization of the previous one to the most general case
    of seperable towers. These algorithms lead to an efficient
    implementation of two methods suggested by Daniel Lazard to solve
    polynomial systems by means of triangular sets. These programs solved
    problems that were previously unreachable. The second method was only
    sketched by its author. So, a second part of this thesis presents the
    necessary developements to describe a right implementation. Moreover,
    a theorecal and unified presentation, together with an experimental
    comparison with similar methods due to Wu Wen-Tsun, Dongming Wang and
    Michael Kalkbrener were realized by Philippe Aubry and are reported in
    a third part of this document."
