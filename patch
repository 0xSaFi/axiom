formulation of a problem to its reduction to executable code.

    "This paper presents a design methodology for deriving an FPGA
    implementation directly from a mathematical specification, thus
    avoiding the switch in semantic perspective as is present in widely
    applied methods which include an imperative implementation as an
    intermediate step.

    The first step in the method presented in this paper is to transform a
    mathematical specification into a Haskell program. The next step is to
    make repetition structures explicit by higher order functions, and
    after that rewrite the specification in the form of a Mealy
    Machine. Finally, adaptations have to be made in order to comply to
    the fixed nature of hardware. The result is then given to
    C$\lambda$aSH, a compiler which generates synthesizable VHDL from the
    resulting Haskell code. An advantage of the approach presented here is
    that in all phases of the process the design can be directly simulated
    by executing the defining code in a standard Haskell environment.

    To illustrate the design process, the N queens problem is chosen as a
    running example."
