    "This class will cover some of the mathematics, history, and
    philosophy of the co-called {\sl foundational crisis in mathematics}. 
    Broadly speaking, mathematics in the late nineteenth and early 
    twentieth centuries was marked by an increased awareness of
    ``foundational issues,'' prompted by a number of problems in the
    practice of mathematics that had accumulated over the years. We will
    discuss a few examples of some of these problems, and then discusssthe
    three major schools of thought that emerged to deal with them and
    provide a coherent philosophical and methodologicial underpinning for
    mathematics.",
