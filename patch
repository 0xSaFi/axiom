  abstract = "
    A major subproblem for algorithms that either factor ordinary linear
    differential equations or compute their closed form solutions is to
    find their solutions $y$ which satisfy $y^{'}/y \in \overline{K}(x)$
    where $K$ is the constant field for the coefficients of the equation.
    While a decision procedure for this subproblem was known in the
    $19^{th}$ century, it requires factoring polynomials over
    $\overline{K}$ and has not been implemented in full generality. We
    present here an efficient algorithm for this subproblem, which has
    been implemented in the AXIOM computer algebra system for equations of
    arbitrary order over arbitrary fields of characteristic 0. This
    algorithm never needs to compute with the individual complex
    singularities of the equation, and algebraic numbers are added only
    when they appear in the potential solutions.  Implementation of the
    complete Singer algorithm for $n=2,3$ based on this building block is
    in progress."
