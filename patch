src/input/* fix failing regression tests for 64 bit

Goal: Axiom Regression Testing

GCL 2.6.12 on 64 bit gives different rounding results for
printed floating point values. It gives an undefined order
on Dictonary entries. It gives new values for the minimum
and maximum integers. This has impacted some regression
tests, which have been fixed.
