    are strong pseudoprimes to some set of prime bases. We apply it to
    find composite numbers which are found to be prime by the Rabin-Miller
    test of packages as Axiom or Maple. We also use a variation of this
    method to construct strong Lucas pseudoprimes with respect to several
    pairs of parameters."
