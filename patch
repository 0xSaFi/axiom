    "Most of us have taken the exact rational and approximate numbers in
    our computer algebra systems for granted for a long time, not thinking
    to ask if they could be significantly better. With exact rational
    arithmetic and adjustable-precision floating-point arithmetic to
    precision limited only by the total computer memory or our patience,
    what more could we want for such numbers?  It turns out that there is
    much that can be done that permits us to obtain exact results more
    often, more intelligible results, approximate results guaranteed to
    have requested error bounds, and recovery of exact results from
    approximate ones."
