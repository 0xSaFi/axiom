    "If we are willing to give up compatibility with IEEE 754 floats and
    design a number format with goals appropriate to 2016, we can achieve
    several goals simultaneously: Extremely high energy efficiency and
    information-per-bit, no penalty for decimal operations instead of
    binary, rigorous bounds on answers without the overly pessimistic
    bounds produced by interval methods, and unprecedented high speed up
    to some precision. This approach extends the ideas of unum arithmetic
    introduced two years ago by breaking completely from the IEEE
    float-type format, resulting in fixed bit size values, fixed execution
    time, no exception values or 'gradual underflow' issues, no wasted bit
    patterns, and no redundant representations (like 'negative zero'). As
    an example of the power of this format, a difficult 12-dimensional
    nonlinear robotic kinematics problem that has defied solvers to date
    is quickly solvable with absolute bounds. Also unlike interval
    methods, it becomes possible to operate on arbitrary disconnected
    subsets of the real number line with the same speed as operating on a
    simple bound."
