Goal: Proving Axiom Correct

\begin{chunk}{axiom.bib}
@misc{WikiED,
  author = "Wikipedia",
  title = "Euclidean Domain"
  year = "2017",
  link = "\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean\_domain}"
}

\end{chunk}

In axiom.sty We added theorem, lemma, proposition, corollary, 
example, remark, definition, qed, axiom as environments for proofs.
