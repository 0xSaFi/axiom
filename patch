    "The Householder reflections used in LAPACK's QR factorization leave
    positive and negative real entries along R's diagonal. This is
    sufficient for most applications of QR factorizations, but a few
    require that R have a non-negative diagonal. This note provides a new
    Householder generation routine to produce a non-negative
    diagonal. Additionally, we find that scanning for trailing zeros in
    the generated reflections leads to large performance improvements when
    applying reflections with many trailing zeros. Factoring low-profile
    matrices, those with non-zero entries mostly near the diagonal (e.g
    band matrices), now requires far fewer operations. For example, QR
    factorization of matrices with profile width $b$ that are stored
    densely in an $n \cross n$ matrix improves form $O(n^3)$ to $O(n^2+nb^2)$."
