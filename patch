    functions, or more generally, to determine whether a certain class of
    functions contains an element $g$ such that $g^\prime = f$."

    In the first part of this thesis, we compare different algorithms for
    symbolic integration. Specifically, we review the integration rules
    taught in calculus courses and how they can be used systematically to
    create a reasonable, but somewhat limited, integration method. Then we
    present the differential algebra required to prove the transcendental
    cases of Risch's algorithm. Risch's algorithm decides if the integral
    of an elementary function is elementary and if so computes it. The
    presentation is mostly self-contained and, we hope, simpler than
    previous descriptions of the algorithm. Finally, we describe
    Risch-Norman's algorithm which, although it is not a decision
    procedure, works well in practice and is considerably simpler than the
    full Risch algorithm.

    In the second part of this thesis, we briefly discuss an
    implementation of a computer algebra system and some of the
    experiences it has given us.  We also demonstrate an implementation of
    the rule-based approach and how it can be used, not only to compute
    integrals, but also to generate readable derivations of the results."

    "This paper proposes a fast algorithm for computing multiplicative
    inverses in $GF(2^m)$ using normal bases. Normal bases have the
    following useful property: In the case that an element $x$ in
    $GF(2^m)$ is represented by normal bases, $2^k$ power operation of an
    element $x$ in $GF(2^m)$ can be carried out by $k$ times cyclic shift
    of its vector representation.  C.C. Wang et al. proposed an algorithm
    for computing multiplicative inverses using normal bases, which
    requires $(m-2)$ multiplications in $GF(2^m)$ and $(m-1)$ cyclic
    shifts. The fast algorithm proposed in this paper also uses normal
    bases, and computes multiplicative inverses iterating multiplications
    in $GF(2^m)$. It requires at most $2[log_2(m-1)]$ multiplications in
    $GF(2^m)$ and $(m-1)$ cyclic shifts, which are much less than those
    required in Wang's method. The same idea of the proposed fast
    algorithm is applicable to the general power operation in $GF(2^m)$
    and the computation of multiplicative inverses in $GF(q^m)$
    $(q=2^n)$."
