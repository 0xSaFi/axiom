    "Modeling and simulating collections of physical objects that are
    subject to a wide variety of physical forces and interactions is
    exceedingly difficult.  The construction of a single simulator capable
    of dealing with all possible physical processes is completely
    impracti- cal and, it seems to us, wrong-headed.  Instead, we propose
    to build custom simulators designed for a particular collection of
    physical objects, where a particular set of physical phenomena are
    involved.  For such an approach to be practical, an environment must
    be provided that facilitates the quick construction of these
    simulators.  In this paper we describe the essential features of such
    an environment and describe in some detail how a general
    implementation of the weighted residual method, one of the more
    general classes of numerical integration techniques, can be used.",
