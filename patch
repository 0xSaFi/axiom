    "This paper presents a method for the simplification of truth-invariant
    cylindrical algebraic decompositions (CADs). Examples are given that
    demonstrate the usefulness of the method in speeding up the solutoin
    formula construction phase of the CAD-based quantifier elimination
    algorithm. Applications of the method to the construction of 
    truth-invariant CADs for very large quantifier-free formulas and
    quantifier elimination of non-prenex formulas are also discussed.",
