books/bookvol13 Start signature type names for Axiom proofs

Goal: Proving Axiom Correct

Lisp functions now have signatures, as in
\sig{functionName}{argTypes}{resultType}

Certain types have standard common lisp types but Axiom semantics.
For instance, 

\sig{executeInterpreterCommand}{Command}{nil}

(defun |executeInterpreterCommand| (command)
  (princ command)
  (terpri)
  (|setCurrentLine| command)
  (catch 'spad_reader (|parseAndInterpret| command))
  (princ (mkprompt))
  (finish-output))


where 'Command' is defined (in book 13) to be 
  Command == String
but we will attach additional semantics during proofs.
