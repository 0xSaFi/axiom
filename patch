Goal: Axiom Website

What do you do with undocumented legacy code? I have A LOT of this
to deal with right now. There are whole libraries used across multiple
webapps and services that are completely undocumented. No javadocs,
no comments in the source code, no flow diagrams, no written explanations,
nothing. Some of these libraries don't even have source code attached to
them, and of course there are no information about them whatsoever on the
internet, so they must have been developed internally, or even worse,
borrowed from mysterious sources. Needless to say that the original devs are
long disappeared, even before I joined the team.

Donald Knuth, like a genius, shattered my illusions. He is so confident
in his code, that he pays bug bounties from his own pocket; for any
kind of bug. Knuth doesn't write code in small pieces. He goes six months
or so without testing his code, then he tests it all at once. When he tests,
he says, "I get into the meanest, nastiest frame of mind that I can manage,
and I write the cruelest test code I can think of; then I turn around and
embed that in even nastier constructions that are almost obscene." At
that point, he tries to test everything. Still, the question is raised,
how does Knuth keep things straight without testing for so long?

Knuth invented literate programming to keep his thoughts clear. He intertwines
the documentation with the code, like a story. Literate programming lets him
structure the code in a way that is easiest to read. He says, "The extra time
I spend in preparing additional commentary is regained because the debugging
time is reduced."
