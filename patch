   "R is a programming language that has been gaining popularity in the
    domains such as machine learning and artificial intelligence over the
    recent years. It has been praised for its simplicity and elasticity,
    and its creators were even assigned a rockstar status.

    In my pamphlet, I claim that this ``blazing new technology'' is
    actually a step backwards in the development of the domains that it
    tries to tackle, and the better means of expression, or better tools
    for doing the job, were available at least since the 70s, and recently
    they were only getting better.

    This pamphlet explores and expresses various {\sl computational
    intelligence methods} using {\sl Guile}, a very pleasant
    implementation of the {\sl Scheme} programming language."
