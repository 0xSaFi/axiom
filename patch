    "The McCallum Projection for Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD)
    produces a smaller projection factor set than previous projections,
    however it does not always produce a sign-invariant CAD for the set of
    input polynomials. Problems may arise when a ($k+1$)-level projection
    factor vanishes identically over a k-level cell. According to
    McCallum's paper, when this happens (and $k+1$ is not the highest
    level in the CAD) we do not know whether the projection is valid,
    i.e. whether or not a sign-invariant CAD for the set of input
    polynomials will be produced when lifting is performed in the usual
    way. When the $k$-level cell in question has dimension 0, McCallum
    suggests a modification of the lifting method that will ensure the
    validity of his projection, although to my knowledge this has never
    been implemented.

    In this paper we give easily computable criteria that often allow us
    to conclude that McCallum's projection is valid even though a
    projection factor vanishes identically over a cell. We also improve on
    McCallum's modified lifting method.

    We've incorporated the ideas contained in the paper into QEPCAD, the
    most complete implementation of CAD. When McCallum's projection is
    invalid because of a projection factor not being order-invariant over a
    region on which it vanishes identically, at least a warning message
    ought to be issued. Currently, QEPCAD may print warning messages that
    are not needed, and may fail to print warning messages when they are
    needed. Our implementation in QEPCAD ensures that warning messages are
    printed when needed, and reduces the number of times warning messages
    are printed when not needed. Neither McCallum's modified lifting
    method nor our improvement of it have been implemented in QEPCAD. The
    design of the system would make implementing such a feature quite
    difficult."
