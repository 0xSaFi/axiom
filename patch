    "We describe an efficient method for the computer evaluation of the
    ordinary irreducible polynomial representations of general linear
    groups using an integral form of the ordinary irreducible
    representations of symmetric groups. In order to do this, we first
    give an algebraic explanation of D. E. Littlewood's modification of
    I. Schur's construction. Then we derive a formula for the entries of
    the representing matrices which is much more concise and adapted to
    the effective use of computer calculations. Finally, we describe how
    one obtains — using this time an orthogonal form of the ordinary
    irreducible representations of symmetric groups — a version which
    yields a unitary representation when it is restricted to the unitary
    subgroup. In this way we adapt D. B. Hunter's results which heavily
    rely on Littlewood's methods, and boson polynomials come into the play
    so that we also meet the needs of applications to physics.",
