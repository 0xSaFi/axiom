    computational logic available to users of computer algebra systems
    while shielding them from its complexity. We have implemented in PVS a
    library of facts about elementary and transcendental function, and
    automatic procedures to attempt proofs of continuity, convergence and
    differentiability for functions in this class. These are called
    directly from Maple by a simple pipe-lined interface. Hence we are
    able to support the analysis of differential equations in Maple by
    direct calls to PVS for: result refinement and verification, discharge
    of verification conditions, harnesses to ensure more reliable
    differential equation solvers, and verifiable look-up tables."

    "This paper describes a method to use compiled, strongly typed Aldor
    domains in the interpreted, expression-oriented Maple
    environment. This represents a non-traditional approach to structuring
    computer algebra software: using an efficient, compiled language,
    designed for writing large complex mathematical libraries, together
    with a top-level system based on user-interface priorities and ease of
    scripting.

    We examine what is required to use Aldor libraries to extend Maple in
    an effective and natural way. Since the computational models of Maple
    and Aldor differ significantly, new run-time code must implement a
    non-trivial semantic correspondence. Our solution allows Aldor
    functions to run tightly coupled to the Maple environment, able to
    directly and efficiently manipulate Maple data objects. We call the
    overall system Alma."

  abstract =
    "We study polynomials of degree up to 4 over the rationals or a
    computable real subfield. Our motivation comes from the need to
    evaluate predicates in nonlinear computational geometry efficiently
    and exactly. We show a new method to compare real algebraic numbers by
    precomputing generalized Sturm sequences, thus avoiding iterative
    methods; the method, moreover handles all degenerate cases. Our first
    contribution is the determination of rational isolating points, as
    functions of the coefficients, between any pair of real roots. Our
    second contribution is to exploit invariants and Bezoutian
    subexpressions in writing the sequences, in order to reduce bit
    complexity. The degree of the tested quantities in the input
    coefficients is optimal for degree up to 3, and for degree 4 in
    certain cases. Our methods readily apply to real solving of pairs of
    quadratic equations, and to sign determination of polynomials over
    algebraic numbers of degree up to 4. Our third contribution is an
    implementation in a new module of library SYNAPS v2.1. It improves
    significantly upon the efficiency of certain publicly available
    implementations: Riobooâ€™s approach on AXIOM, the package of
    Guibas-Karavelas-Russel, and CORE v1.6, MAPLE v9, and SYNAPS
    v2.0. Some existing limited tests had shown that it is faster than
    commercial library LEDA v4.5 for quadratic algebraic numbers."

    Real algebraic numbers appear in many Computer Algebra problems.  For
    instance the determination of a cylindrical algebraic decomposition
    for an euclidean space requires computing with real algebraic numbers.
    This paper describes an implementation for computations with the real
    roots of a polynomial. This process is designed to be recursively
    used, so the resulting domain of computation is the set of all real
    algebraic numbers. An implementation for the real algebraic closure
    has been done in Axiom (previously called Scratchpad)."
