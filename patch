    introduces a small overhead that grows with the square of the

    "The ultimate objective of this paper is to create a stepping stone to
    the development of new quantum algorithms. The strategy chosen is to
    begin by focusing on the class of abelian quantum hidden subgroup
    algorithms, i.e., the class of abelian algorithms of the Shor/Simon
    genre. Our strategy is to make this class of algorithms as
    mathematically transparent as possible. By the phrase ``mathematically
    transparent'' we mean to expose, to bring to the surface, and to make
    explicit the concealed mathematical structures that are inherently and
    fundamentally a part of such algorithms. In so doing, we create
    symbolic abelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms that are analogous
    to the those symbolic algorithms found within such software packages
    as Axiom, Cayley, Maple, Mathematica, and Magma.

    As a spin-off of this effort, we create three different
    generalizations of Shor’s quantum factoring algorithm to free abelian
    groups of finite rank. We refer to these algorithms as wandering (or
    vintage $\mathbb{Z}_Q$) Shor algorithms. They are essentially quantum
    algorithms on free abelian groups of finite rank $n$ which, with each
    iteration, first select a random cyclic direct summand $\mathbb{Z}$ of
    the group and then apply one iteration of the standard Shor algorithm
    to produce a random character of the “approximating” finite group
    $\widetilde{A} = \mathbb{Z}_Q$, called the group probe. These
    characters are then in turn used to find either the order $P$ of a
    maximal cyclic subgroup $\mathbb{Z}_P$ of the hidden quotient group
    $H_{\varphi}$, or the entire hidden quotient group $H_{\varphi}$. An
    integral part of these wandering quantum algorithms is the selection
    of a very special random transversal $t_{\mu}:\widetilde{A}\rightarrow A$,
    which we refer to as a Shor transversal. The algorithmic time
    complexity of the first of these wandering Shor algorithms is found to
    be $O(n^2({rm lg\ } Q)^3 ({\rm lg\ }{\rm lg\ } Q)^{n+1})$."
