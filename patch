    language of elementary algebra, or in one of its extensions, but which
    do not really depend on the coordinate system, and in which the 
    variables can be restricted to an arbitrary small neighborhood of some
    point. It seems that it ought to be possible to use cylindrical
    decomposition techniques to solve such problems, taking advantage
    of their special features. This article attempts to do this, but
    many unsolved problems remain.",

    "Quantifier elimination for the elementary formal theory of real
    numbers is a facinating area of research at the intersection of
    various field of mathematics and computer science, such as
    mathematical logic, commutative algebra and algebraic geometry,
    computer algebra, computational geometry and complexity
    theory. Originally the method of quantifier elimination was invented
    (among others by Th. Skolem) in mathematical logic as a technical tool
    for solving the decision problem for a formalized mathematical
    theory. For the elementary formal theory of real numbers (or more
    accurately of real closed fields) such a quantifier elimination
    procedure was established in the 1930s by A. Tarski, using an
    extension of Sturm's theorem of the 1830s for counting the number of
    real zeros of a univariate polynomial in a given interval. Since then
    an abundance of new decision and quantifier elimination methods for
    this theory with variations and optimizations has been published with
    the aim both of establishing the theoretical complexity of the problem
    and of finding methods that are of practical importance (see Arnon
    1988a and the discussion and references in Renegar 1992a, 1992b, 1992c
    for a comparison of these methods). For subproblems such as
    elimination of quantifiers with respect to variables, that are
    linearly or quadratically restricted, specialized methods have been
    developed with good success (see Weispfenning 1988, Loos and
    Weispfenning 1993; Hong 1992d; Weispfenning 1997).",
