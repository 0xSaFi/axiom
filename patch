    The generalization applies to fields $F(t_1,\ldots,t_n)$ where $F$ 
    is a differential field (in our applications $F$ will be a finitely 
    generated extension of $Q$, the field of rational numbers) and each $t_i$ 
    is either algebraic over $F_{i-1}=F(t_1,\ldots,t_{i-1})$, is an 
    exponential of an element in $F_{i-1}$, or is an integral of an element 
    in $F_{i-1}$. If $t_i$ is an integral and can be expressed using 
    logarithms, it must be so expressed for the generalized structure 
    theorem to apply."

    "In Part 1 of this paper, we give an extension of Liouville's Theorem
    and give a number of examples which show that integration with special
    functions involves some phenomena that do not occur in integration
    with the elementary functions alone. Our main result generalizes
    Liouville's Theorem by allowing, in addition to the elementary
    functions, special functions such as the error function, Fresnel
    integrals and the logarithmic integral (but not the dilogarithm or
    exponential integral) to appear in the integral of an elementary
    function. The basic conclusion is that these functions, if they
    appear, appear linearly. We give an algorithm which decides if an
    elementary function, built up using only exponential functions and
    rational operations has an integral which can be expressed in terms of
    elementary functions and error functions."

    formalisations related to algebraic structures -- as a result, an
    algebraic hierarchy ranging from setoids to vector spaces has been
    developed. The resultant tools can be used to simplify the development
    of generic theories about algebraic structures. In particular, the
    benefits of using the tools presented in this paper, compared to a
    from-scratch approach, are especially relevant when working with
    complex mathematical structures; for example, the structures employed
    in Algebraic Topology. This work shows that ACL2 can be a suitable
    tool for formalising algebraic concepts coming, for instance, from
    computer algebra systems."

    {\sl mathematical structures} in the ACL2 theorem prover. Namely, we
    cope with the representation of mathematical structures, the
    certification that an object fulfills the axioms characterizing an
    algebraic structure and the generation of generic theories about
    concrete structures. As a by-product, an {\sl ACL2 algebraic
    hierarchy} has been obtained. Our framework has been tested with the
    definition of {\sl homology groups}, an example coming from
    Homological Algebra which involves several notions related to
    Universal Algebra. The method presented here, when compared to a
    from-scratch approach, is preferred when working with complex
    mathematical structures; for instance, the ones coming from Algebraic
    Topology. The final aim of this work is the verification of Computer
    Algebra systems, a field where our hierarchy fits better than the ones
    developed in other systems."

    "Locales are a module system for managing theory hierarchies in a
    theorem prover through theory interpretation. They are available for
    the theorem prover Isabelle. In this paper, their semantics is defined
    in terms of local theories and morphisms. Locales aim at providing
    flexible means of extension and reuse. Theory modules (which are
    called locales) may be extended by definitions and
    theorems. Interpretation of Isabelle's global theories and proof
    contexts is possible via morphisms. Even the locale hierarchy may be
    changed if declared relations between locales do not adequately
    reflect logical relations, which are implied by the locales'
    specifications. By discussing their design and relating it to more
    commonly known structuring mechanisms of programming languages and
    provers, locales are made accessible to a wider audience beyond the
    users of Isabelle. The discussed mechanisms include ML-style functors,
    type classes and mixins (the latter are found in modern
    object-oriented languages)."
