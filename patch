  abstract =
    "The solutions of Lyapunov and generalized Lyapunov equations are a
    key player in many applications in systems and control theory. Their
    stable numerical computation, when the full solution is sought, is
    considered solved since the seminal work of Bartels and Stewart. A
    number of variants of their algorithm have been proposed, but none of
    them goes beyond BLAS level-2 style implementation. On modern
    computers, however, the formulation of BLAS level-3 type
    implementations is crucial to enable optimal usage of cache
    hierarchies and modern block scheduling methods based on directed
    acyclic graphs describing the interdependence of single block
    computations. Our contribution closes this gap by a transformation of
    the aforementioned level-2 variants to level-3 versions and a
    comparison on a standard multicore machine."
