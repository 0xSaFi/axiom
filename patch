   There are 8 exposed and 1 unexposed library operations named hash 
      having 1 argument(s) but none was determined to be applicable. 
      Use HyperDoc Browse, or issue
                              )display op hash
      to learn more about the available operations. Perhaps 
      package-calling the operation or using coercions on the arguments
      will allow you to apply the operation.
 
   Cannot find a definition or applicable library operation named hash 
      with argument type(s) 
                             Record(f1: Integer)
      
      Perhaps you should use "@" to indicate the required return type, 
      or "$" to specify which version of the function you need.
