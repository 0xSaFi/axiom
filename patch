    "One way in which mathematicians deal with infinite amounts of data is
    symbolic representation. A simple example is the quadratic equation
    \[x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]
    a formula which uses symbolic representation to describe the solutions
    to an infinite class of equations. Most computer algebra systems can
    deal with polynomials with symbolic coefficients, but what if symbolic
    exponents are called for (e.g. $1+t^i$)? What if symbolic limits on
    summations are also called for, for example
    \[1+t+\ldots+t^i=\sum_j{t^j}\]

    The ``Scratchpad Concept'' is a theoretical ideal which allows the
    implementation of objects at this level of abstraction and beyond in a
    mathematically consistent way. The Axiom computer algebra system is an
    implementation of a major part of the Scratchpad Concept.  Axiom
    (formerly called Scratchpad) is a language with extensible
    parameterized types and generic operators which is based on the
    notions of domains and categories. By examining some aspects of the
    Axiom system, the Scratchpad Concept will be illustrated. It will be
    shown how some complex problems in homologicial algebra were solved
    through the use of this system."
