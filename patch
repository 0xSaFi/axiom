    respect to Hoare's system. A subgoaler for the deduction system is
    described whose input is a significant subset of Pascal programs plus
    inductive assertions. The output is a set of verification conditions
    or lemmas to be proved. Several non-trivial arithmetic and sorting
    programs have been shown to satisfy specifications by using an
    interactive theorem prover to automatically generate proofs of the
    verification conditions. Additional components for a more powerful

    inductive assertion method: given a program and its specifications,
    the object is to generate the verification conditions, simplify them,
    and prove what remains. The important feature of the system is that
    the human user has the opportunity and obligation to help actively in
    the simplifying and proving. The user, for example, is the primary
    source of problem domain facts and properties needed in the proofs. A
    general description is given of the overall design philosophy,
    structure, and functional components of the system, and a simple
    sorting program is used to illustrate both the behavior of major
    system components and the type of user interaction the system provides.",

    presented on the scope in its natural form so that the user can easily
    comprehend it and, by a series of interactive commands, can help with
    the proof when he desires. A feature called DETAIL is employed which
    allows the human to interact only when needed and only to the extent
    necessary for the proof.

    natural-deduction-like theorem proving technique which has been
