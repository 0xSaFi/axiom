    whose corresponding Markov chain is of order 2. This corresponds to
    the walk having a memory of one previous step. We derive the

    differ from bot classical random walks, and quantum walks without

    "Coordinated by Joris van der Hoeven from the 90's, the Mathemagix
    project aims at the design of a scientific programming language for
    symbolic and certified numeric algorithms. This language can be
    compiled and interpreted, and it features a strong type system with
    classes and categories. Several C++ libraries are also being
    developed, mainly with Bernard Mourrain and Philippe Trebuchet, for
    the elementary operations with polynomials, power series and matrices,
    with a special care towards efficiency and numeric stability.

    In my talk I will give an overview of the language, of the design and
    the contents of the C++ libraries, and I will illustrate possibilities
    offered for certified numeric computations with balls and intervals."

    "Many (2D) Dynamic Geometry Systems (DGSs) are able to export numeric
    coordinates and equations with numeric coefficients to Computer
    Algebra Systems (CASs). Moreoever, different approaches and systems
    that linke (2D) DGSs with CASs, so that symbolic coordinates and
    equations with symbolic coefficients can be exported from the DGS to
    the CAS, already exist. Although the 2D DGS Calques3D can export
    numeric coordinates and equations with numeric coefficients to Maple
    and Mathematica, it cannot export symbolic coordinates and equations
    with symbolic coefficients. A connetion between the 3D DGS Calques3D
    and the CAS Maple, that can handle symbolic coordinates and equations
    with symbolic coefficients, is presented here. Its main interest is to
    provide a convenient time-saving way to explore problems and directly
    obtain both algebraic and numeric data when dealing with a 3D
    extension of ``ruler and compass geometry''. This link has not only
    educational purposes but mathematical ones, like mechanical theorem
    proving in geometry, geometry discovery (hypothesis completion),
    geometric loci finding -- As far as we know, there is no comparable
    ``symbolic'' link in the 3D case, except the prototype 3D-LD
    (restricted to determining algebraic surfaces as geometric loci)."

    "How do we recognize when an answer is ``right''? This is a question
    that has bedevilled the use of computer systems in mathematics (as
    opposed to arithmetic) ever since their introduction. A computer
    system can certainly say that some answers are definitely wrong, in
    the sense that they are provably not an answer to the question
    posed. However, an answer can be mathematically right without being
    pedagogically right. Here we explore the differences and show that,
    despite the apparent distinction, it is possible to make many of the
    differences amenable to formal treatment, by asking ``under which
    congruence is the pupil's answer equal to the teacher's?''."

    theoretical and practical improvements over a direct recursive
    approach; for a family of special cases, we reach quasi-linear
    complexity. The main outcome we have in mind is the acceleration of
    higher-level algorithms, by interfacing our low-level implemention
    with languages such as AXIOM or Maple. We show the potential for hugh
    speed-ups, by comparing two AXIOM implementations of vanHoeij and
    Monagan's modular GCD algorithm."

    It is implemented through projections functions, this enables us to
    provide canonical representations which are commonly used in Computer
    Algebra but seldom formally described. We further provide a FoCaL
    formalization for the code used inside the library for modular
    arithmetic through the certification of quotient groups and quotient
    rings which are involved in the model. We finally instantiate our
    framework to provide a trusted replacement of the existing FoCaL

    multiple variables, standart trigonometric and exponential functions,
    various special functions for example gamma, zeta, Bessel, etc. and
    also arbitrary functions like derivatives, integrals, sums, and
    products of expressions. Our implementation of a CAS tool provides an

    platforms and highly scalable. The other key features include a very
    simple and interactive user GUI support for a formula editor, making
    it a self contained system, additionally the formula editor provides a
