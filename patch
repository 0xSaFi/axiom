    "Dynamic evaluation is a general method for computing with parameters
    [6, 9]. In 1994, T. Gomez-Diaz implemented the dynamic constructible
    closure in the scientific computation system Axiom [17]: by simulating
    dynamic evaluation, it offers the possibility to compute with
    parameters in a very large way [13]. The outputs of a calculs with
    T. Gomez-Diaz programs are represented by a finite collection of
    constructible triangular systems defined in [12, definition
    p.106]. Though there are numerous applications of these programs
    (notably polynomial system solving with parameters [11], automatic
    geometric theorem proving [14, 15], computation of Jordan forms with
    parameters [16]), nobody gives theorical interest to this kind of
    triangular systems. The main reason of this phenomenon is that they
    are definied in [12] within the dynamic evaluation context. On the
    opposite, most notions of triangular systems (J.F. Ritt-W.T. Wu
    characteristic sets [24, 28], M. Kalkbrener regular chains [18],
    D. Lazard triangular sets [20], M. Moreno Maza regular sets [22],
    D.M. Wang simple systems [26, 27]) are defined in terms of commutative
    algebra. This problem is at the origin of the work done in [7] where
    we give a relevant algebraic model of T. Gomez-Diaz systems within
    commutative algebra terminology. This allows us to relate them to many
    concepts of triangular systems [7]. Thus, we give interest to the
    connections with D. Lazard triangular sets in [8]. In a way, this
    paper is the continuation of this previous work. This time, we study
    relationships between T. Gomez-Diaz systems and D.M. Wang simple
    systems. The paper is structured as follows. We have collected in
    section 2 some needed notations. In section 3, we give all the
    terminology related to our algebraic model of T. Gomez-Diaz
    systems. Thus, we define the notion of weak constructible triangular
    systems and introduce the properties of normalization and
    squarefreeness. Section 4 is more detailed.  First of all, we study a
    weaker form of normalization called $L$-normalization. Then we give
    many properties of constructible triangular systems verifying this new
    notion. We obtain an algebraic and geometric framework which permits,
    in section 5, to explore the connections between T. Gomez-Diaz systems
    and D.M. Wang simple systems. In particular, this last section will
    demonstrate well the importance of our $L$-normalization
    property. Indeed, we show that simple systems and squarefree
    $L$-normalized constructible triangular systems are equivalent."

    "Polynomial systems can be found in many industrial applications. They
    are also in the heart of effective algebraic geometry. A fundamental
    tool for studying them is the Groebner bases. The knowledge of this
    paricular base of the ideal generated by the polynomials composing the
    system allows us to compute in $A=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/I$, the quotient
    algebra, and this is necessary when we try to solve. Nevertheless,
    Groebner bases computations rely heavily on the introduction of
    monomial ordering. This introduces a certain rigidity in the
    computation and thus numerical instability. We propose a new algorithm
    that tries to remedy that problem. It generalises Groebner bases
    computation and is much less numerically instable. To do this, we
    decrease the requirement of monomial ordering, and use a new normal
    form criterion. We then give an algorithm and prove its termination
    and correctness when the input polynomial system is
    0-dimensional. After, we compare it with the previously known methods
    and show how it can be seen as a generalisation of them. Next, we
    detail how we implemented it in C++ using the Synaps library. We also
    describe the sparse matrix elimination algorithm we used in or
    program. Finally, we present some of the experiments we have done with
    our program in domains like computer vision, algorithmic geometry,
    robotics, or pharmacology."

    obtaining a canonical CGS. We define the objective, show the
