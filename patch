    "The following consists of notes which were privately circulated in
    1969. Since they have been referred to a few times in the literature,
    it seems worth while to publish them. They have been rearranged for
    easier reading, and some inessential corrections have been made.
    
    The ultimate goal was to develop a notion of construction suitable for
    the interpretation of intuitionistic mathematics. The notion of
    construction developed in the notes is certainly too crude for that,
    so the use of the word {\sl construction} is not very appropriate.
    However, the terminology has been kept in order to preserve the
    original title and also to preserve the character of the notes. The
    title has a second defect; namely, the {\sl type} should be regarded
    as a abstract object whereas a {\sl formula} is the name of a type.",
