    An introduction to the formal theory of partial differential equations
    is given emphasizing the properties of involutive symbols and
    equations.  An algorithm to complete any differential equation to an
    involutive one is presented. For an involutive equation possible
    values for the number of arbitrary functions in its general solution
    are determined. The existence and uniqueness of solutions for analytic
    equations is proven.  Applications of these results include an
    analysis of symmetry and reduction methods and a study of gauge
    systems. It is show that the Dirac algorithm for systems with
    constraints is closely related to the completion of the equation of
    motion to an involutive equation. Specific examples treated comprise
    the Yang-Mills Equations, Einstein Equations, complete and Jacobian
    systems, and some special models in two and three dimensions. To
    facilitate the involved tedious computations an environment for
    geometric approaches to differential equations has been developed in
    the computer algebra system Axiom. The appendices contain among others
    brief introductions into Carten-K{\"a}hler Theory and Janet-Riquier
    Theory.",
