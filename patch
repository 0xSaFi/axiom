    "Wilkinson defined a sparse matrix as one with enough zeros that it
    pays to take advantage of them. This informal yet practical definition
    captures the essence of the goal of direct methods for solving sparse
    matrix problems. They exploit the sparsity of a matrix to solve
    problems economically: much faster and using far less memory than if
    all the entries of a matrix were stored and took part in explicit
    computations. These methods form the backbone of a wide range of
    problems in computational science. A glimpse of the breadth of
    applications relying on sparse solvers can be seen in the origins of
    matrices in published matrix benchmark collections. The goal of this
    survey article is to impart a working knowledge of the underlying
    theory and practice of sparse direct methods for solving linear
    systems and least-squares problems, and to provide an overview of the
    algorithms, data structures, and software available to solve these
    problems, so that the reader can both understand the methods and know
    how best to use them."
