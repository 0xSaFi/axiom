    "Mathematical texts can be computerised in many ways that capture
    differing amounts of the mathematical meaning. At one end, there is
    document imag- ing, which captures the arrangement of black marks on
    paper, while at the other end there are proof assistants (e.g., Mizar,
    Isabelle, Coq, etc.), which capture the full mathematical meaning and
    have proofs expressed in a formal foundation of mathematics. In
    between, there are computer typesetting systems (e.g., LATEX and
    Presentation MathML) and semantically oriented systems (e.g., Content
    MathML, OpenMath, OMDoc, etc.). In this paper we advocate a style of
    computerisation of mathematical texts which is flexible enough to
    connect the different approaches to computerisation, which allows
    various degrees of formalisation, and which is compatible with
    different logical frameworks (e.g., set theory, category theory, type
    theory, etc.) and proof systems. The basic idea is to allow a
    man-machine collaboration which weaves human input with machine
    computation at every step in the way. We propose that the huge step
    from informal mathematics to fully formalised mathematics be divided
    into smaller steps, each of which is a fully developed method in which
    human input is minimal.  Let us consider the following two questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the relationship between the logical foundations of 
    mathematical reasoning and the actual practice of mathematicians?
    \item In what ways can computers support the development and 
    communication of mathematical knowledge?
    \end{enumerate}"
