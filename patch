   "Symbolic and logic computation systems ranging from computer algebra
   systems to theorem provers are finding their way into science,
   technology, mathematics and engineering. But such systems rely on
   explicitly or implicitly represented mathematical knowledge that needs
   to be managed to use such systems effectively.
   
   While mathematical knowledge management (MKM) ``in the small'' is
   well-studied, scaling up to large, highly interconnected corpora
   remains difficult. We hold that in order to realize MKM “in the
   large”, we need representation languages and software architectures
   that are designed systematically with large-scale processing in mind.
   
   Therefore, we have designed and implemented the Mmt language – a
   module system for mathematical theories. Mmt is designed as the
   simplest possible language that combines a module system, a
   foundationally uncommitted formal semantics, and web-scalable
   implementations. Due to a careful choice of representational
   primitives, Mmt allows us to integrate existing representation
   languages for formal mathematical knowledge in a simple, scalable
   formalism. In particular, Mmt abstracts from the underlying
   mathematical and logical foundations so that it can serve as a
   standardized representation format for a formal digital
   library. Moreover, Mmt systematically separates logic-dependent and
   logic-independent concerns so that it can serve as an interface layer
   between computation systems and MKM systems.",

   "The Mmt language has been developed as a scalable representation and
   interchange language for formal mathematical knowledge. It permits
   natural representations of the syntax and semantics of virtually all
   declarative languages while making Mmt-based MKM services easy to
   implement. It is foundationally unconstrained and can be instantiated
   with specific formal languages.
   
   The Mmt API implements the Mmt language along with multiple backends
   for persistent storage and frontends for machine and user
   access. Moreover, it implements a wide variety of Mmt-based knowledge
   management services. The API and all services are generic and can be
   applied to any language represented in Mmt. A plugin interface permits
   injecting syntactic and semantic idiosyncrasies of individual formal
   languages.",

  abstract =
   "Throughout the twentieth century, the automation of formal logics in
   computers has created unprecedented potential for practical
   applications of logic—most prominently the mechanical verification of
   mathematics and software. But the high cost of these applications
   makes them infeasible but for a few flagship projects, and even those
   are negligible compared to the ever-rising needs for verification. One
   of the biggest challenges in the future of logic will be to enable
   applications at much larger scales and simultaneously at much lower
   costs. This will require a far more efficient allocation of
   resources. Wherever possible, theoretical and practical results must
   be formulated generically so that they can be instantiated to
   arbitrary logics; this will allow reusing results in the face of
   today’s multitude of application-oriented and therefore diverging
   logical systems. Moreover, the software engineering problems
   concerning automation support must be decoupled from the theoretical
   problems of designing logics and calculi; this will allow researchers
   outside or at the fringe of logic to contribute scalable
   logic-independent tools. Anticipating these needs, the author has
   developed the Mmt framework. It offers a modern approach towards
   defining, analyzing, implementing, and applying logics that focuses on
   modular design and logic-independent results. This paper summarizes
   the ideas behind and the results about Mmt. It focuses on showing how
   Mmt. provides a theoretical and practical framework for the future of
   logic.",

    program GENTZEN based on Gentzen's sequent calculus, which
    incorporates some features of Prolog's computation procedure. We show
    that GENTZEN has the following properties: (1) It is
    (non-deterministically) sound and complete for first-order
    intuitionistic predicate calculus; (2) Its successful computations
    coincide with those of Prolog on the Horn clause fragment (both
    deterministically and non-deterministically). The proofs of (1) and
    (2) contain a new proof of the completeness of (non-deterministic)
    Prolog for Horn clause logic, based on our analysis of Prolog in terms
    of Gentzen sequents instead of on resolution. GENTZEN has been
    implemented and tested on examples including some proofs by induction
    in number theory, an example constructed by J. McCarthy to show the
    limitations of Prolog, and ``Schubert's Steamroller.'' An extension of
    GENTZEN also provides a decision procedure for intuitionistic
    propositional calculus (but at some cost in efficiency).",
