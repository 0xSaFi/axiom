Goal: Axiom Literate Programming

\begin{quote}
``AXIOM is a milestone in the history of computation. It sets a new
standard for depth and breadth of mathematical software. AXIOM is
a fully integrated environment for exploratory research in mathematics,
easily extensible to new domains. I recommend this book to all researchers
and teachers of advanced courses in scientific and mathematical 
disciplines.''\\
{\bf Anil Nerode}\\
Director, Mathematical Sciences Institute\\
Goldwin Smit Professor of Mathematics, Cornell Univerity
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``The AXIOM language is a jewel that should receive wide attention among
mathematicians as potential users and among computer scientists as a
model for excellence in lanuage design''\\
{\bf Michael Rabin}\\
Thomas J. Watson, Sr., Professor of Computer Science\\
Harvard University\\
Albert Einstein Professor of Mathematics\\
Hebrew University
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``AXIOM has captured the excitement of the French mathematical community.
It is the first of a new generation of computer algebra systems, and is
highly efficient for large and difficult computations.''\\
{\bf Daniel Lazard}\\
Professor d'Informatique\\
Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris VI
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``The abstraction capabilities of AXIOM are unparalleled among presently
available computer algebra systems. Many natural mathematical constructions,
very awkward in other systems, remain natural and simple in AXIOM''\\
{\bf Willard Miller, Jr.}\\
Professor and Associate Director\\
Institute for Mathematics and its Applications\\
University of Minnesota
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``AXIOM is the culmination of a quarter of a century of research at IBM.
It represents an important new generation of computer algebra systems.''\\
{\bf Joel Moses}\\
Dean of Engineering\\
D.C. Jackson Professor of Computer Science and Engineering\\
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``AXIOM is a dream come true - a powerful, fast, flexible system soundly
based on the principles of modern mathematics. For anyone who does a
substantial amount of empirical mathematics, AXIOM is a godsend.''\\
{\bf George E. Andrews}\\
Evan Pugh Professor of Mathematics\\
Pennsylvania State University
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
``I strongly recommend that statisticians acquaint themselves with AXIOM
for at least two very good reasons. Its algebraic strength offers help
with the combinatoric problems of design of experiments while the
tensor-calculus facilities can provide powerful tools for likelihood
inference.''\\
{\bf John Nelder}\\
Fellow of the Royal Society\\
Professor of Imperial College, London
