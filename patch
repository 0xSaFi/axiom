  abstract = "Dijkstra's remark to the effect that testing can only 
    demonstrate the presence of errors and not their absence is
    unquestionably true. This observation, together with the recent
    development of techniques for formally proving programs to be correct,
    has led some computer scientists to believe that correctness proofs
 
    can replace testing as a means for insuring that programs do what
    they are supposed to do. The purpose of this note is to point out
    several reasons why even programs rigorously proven to be correct
    should be neertheless thoroughly tested. Correctness proofs can
    supplement, but cannot replace comprehensive testing."
