    "Let $y$ be an algebraic function defined by a polynomial equation
    $P(x,y)=0$ whose coefficients are polynomials in $x$ over a field $K$
    which may be one of the fields $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$, or
    $\mathbb{C}$.  D. V. and G. V. Chudnovsky [J. Complexity 2, 271-294
    (1986; Zbl 0629.68038); ibid. 3, 1-25 (1987; Zbl 0656.34003)] describe
    a pair of algorithms to calculate the coefficients in the
    Laurent-Puiseux developments of the branches of $y$: The first
    algorithm returns a linear differential equation
    \[q_n(x)y^{(n)} + y_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)}+\cdots+q_1(x)y^{'}+q_0(x)y=0\]
    which is satisfied by all branches of $y$ and whose coefficients are
    polynomials in $x$ over $K$, the other uses this differential equation
    to get a linear recurrence relation for the Puiseux coefficients. The
    author used this algorithms (the second in a simpler version) to
    calculate the recurrence relation; if this relation contains only two
    terms, an algorithm found by the author returns an explicit formula
    for the Puiseux coefficients [J. Symb. Comp. 13, 581-603 (1992; Zbl
    0758.30026)].  In this paper, the author gives examples to illustrate
    his algorithms and to show that for many algebraic functions defined
    by polynomials of low degree a closed form of their Puiseux
    coefficients may be calculated. He points out that on the other side
    the complexity of the resulting recurrence equation may be extremely
    high even for an algebraic function defined by a sparse polynomial of
    low degree."

    this paper, we compute composite numbers which are strong pseudoprimes
    to several chosen bases. Because these bases are those used by the
    ScratchPad implementation of the test, we obtain, by a method which
    differs from a recent one by G. Jaeschke [ibid. 61, 915-926 (1993; Zbl

    various ways, depending both on the input and on the sequence of
    operations used. If a given input $\sigma$ can produce a particular
    output $\tau$ then $(\sigma,\tau)$ is said to be an allowable pair. It
    is shown that allowable pairs on a fixed multiset are in one-to-one
    correspondence with certain $k$-way trees and, consequently, the
    allowable pairs can be enumerated. Algorithms are presented for
    determining the number of allowable pairs with a fixed input
    component, or with a fixed output component. Finally, generating
    functions are used to study the maximum number of output components
    with a fixed input component, and a symmetry result is derived."

    "Let $k$ be a field and $f \in k[x]$ be a polynomial of degree $n$. The
    permutation action of $G$ on the roots $\{\alpha_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of $f$
    can be determined by an algorithm suggested by R. Stauduhar
    [Math. Comput. 27, 981-996 (1973; Zbl 0282.12004)] that approximates $G$
    via successive steps in a chain of subgroups 
    $S_n=H_0 > H_1 > \ldots > H_k=G$. In each step $H_{i-1} > H_i$ 
    it checks as a test for $G \le H_i$ whether a relative invariant $k_i
    \in k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ yields a value under the specialization
    $\varphi : g(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \mapsto g(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)$.  In
    implementations this evaluation has been done using $p$-adic
    [H. Darmon and D. Ford, Commun. Algebra 17, No. 12, 2941-2943 (1989;
    Zbl 0693.12010)] or numerical (R. Stauduhar [ibid.]; Y. Eichenlaub and
    M. Olivier [preprint]) approximation of the roots.
    
    The paper under review presents a new approach which avoids all
    approximations: If $G \le H_i$ and $H_i$ is maximal in $H_{i-1}$ the
    invariant $h_i$ is a primitive element of the invariant field 
    $k_i=k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)^{H_i}$ as an extension of 
    $k_{i-1}=K(x_1,\ldots,x_n)^{H_{i-1}}$.
    The author develops an algorithm to express the specialized values 
    $\varphi(g)$ of elements $g \in k_i$ in terms of $k_{i-1}$ and the 
    specialization $\varphi(h_i)$.
    
    This algorithm then is applied to the relative resolvent polynomial
    \[s_i = \prod_a{(y-a(x_1,\ldots,x_n))}\]
    where $a$ runs through the images of $h_i$ under $H_{i-1}. 
    It has $y$-coefficients which are in $k_{i-1}$. 
    The algorithm then permits to express the coefficients of the
    specialization $r_i(y)=\varphi(s_i) \in k[y]$ recursively in the 
    (already known) specializations $\varphi(h_i)$ for $j \le i-1$,
    using the coefficients of $f$ (as $S_n$-invariants in the roots) 
    as a seed. A root of $r_i(y)$ in the base field then proves that $G$
    is contained in (a conjugate of) $H_i$, and this value of the root can 
    be used as specialized $\varphi(h_{i+1})$ in the next step of the 
    algorithm. Special care is given to the case when denominators of 
    elements in $k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ evaluate to zero after specialization.
    
    The paper closes with a short discussion of applicability. An
    implementation using AXIOM and GAP is in process but has not yet been
    completed."
