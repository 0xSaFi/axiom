    "Numerical programs may require a high level of guarantee. This can be
    achieved by applying formal methods, such as machine-checked proofs.
    But these tools handle mathematical theorems while we are interested
    in C code, in which numerical computations are performed using
    floating-point arithmetic, whereas proof tools typically handle exact
    real arithmetic. To achieve this high level of confidence on C programs,
    we use a chain of tools: Frama-C, its Jessie plugin, Why and provers
    among Coq, Gappa, Alt-Ergo, CVC3 and Z3. This approach requires the C
    program to be annotated; each function must be precisely specified, and
    we prove the correctness of the program by proving both that it meets its
    specifications and that no runtime error may occur. The purpose of this
    paper is to illustrate, on various examples, the features of this 
    approach.",

    "This paper introduces a methodology to perform formal verification of
    floating-point C programs.  It extends an existing tool for
    verification of C programs, Caduceus, with new annotations for
    specific floating-point arithmetic. The Caduceus first-order logic
    model for C programs is extended accordingly. Then verification
    conditions are obtained in the usual way and can be discharged
    interactively with the Coqa proof assistant, using an existing Coq
    formalization of floating-point arithmetic. This methodology is
    already implemented and has been successfully applied to several short
    floating-point programs, which are presented in this paper.",
