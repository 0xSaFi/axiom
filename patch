    "It is argued that formal verifications of programs, no matter how
    obtained, will not play the same key role in the development of 
    computer science and software engineering as proofs do in mathematics.
    Furthermore the absence of continuity, the inevitability of change, and
    the complexity of specification of significantly many real programs
    make the formal verification process difficult to justify and manage.
    It is felt that ease of formal verification should not dominate program
    language design.",
