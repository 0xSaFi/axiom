    "In this thesis we address algorithms for polynomial factorisation
    over finite fields. In the univariate case, we study a recent
    algorithm due to Niederreiter where the factorisation problem is
    reduced to solving a linear system over the finite field in question,
    and the solutions are used to produce the complete factorisation of
    the polynomials into irreducibles. We develop a new algorithm for
    solving the linear system using sparse Gaussian elimination with the
    Markowitz ordering strategy, and conjecture that the Niederreiter
    linear system is not only initially sparse, but also preserves its
    sparsity throughout the Gaussian elimination phase. We develop a new
    bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) algorithm base on the approach of
    Gottfert for extracting the factors of a polynomial using a basis of
    the Niederreiter solution set of $\mathbb{F}_2$. We improve upon the
    complexity and performance of the original algorithm, and produce
    binary univariate factorisations of trinomials up to degree 400000.

    We present a new approach to multivariate polynomial factorisation
    which incorporates ideas from polyhedral geometry, and generalises
    Hensel lifting. The contribution is an algorithm for factoring
    bivariate polynomials via polytopes which is able to exploit to some
    extent the sparsity of polynomials. We further show that the polytope
    method can be made sensitive to the number of nonzero terms of the
    input polynomial. We describe a sparse adaptation of the polytope
    method over finite fields of prime order which requires fewer bit
    operations and memory references for polynomials which are known to be
    the product of two sparse factors. Using this method, and to the best
    of our knowledge, we achieve a world record in binary bivariate
    factorisation of a sparse polynomial of degree 20000. We develop a BSP
    variant of the absolute irreducibility testing via polytopes given in
    [45], producing a more memory and run time efficient method that can
    provide wider ranges of applicability. We achieve absolute
    irreducibility testing of a bivariate and trivariate polynomial of
    degree 30000, and of multivariate polynomials with up to 3000
    variables."

    $x\times n$ matrix over a field $K$ are introduced. The complexity of
    the first algorithm, where the complete factorization of the 
    characteristic polynomial is needed, is $O(\sqrt{n}\cdot n^3)$. An
    iterative algorithm for finding the minimal polynomial has complexity
    $O(n^3+n^2m^2)$, where $m$ is a parameter of the shift Hessenberg
    matrix used. The method does not require the knowlege of the
    characteristic polynomial. The average value of $m$ is $O(log n)$.

    Next methods are discussed for finding a cyclic vector for a matrix.
    The authors first consider the case when its characteristic polynomial
    is squarefree. Using the shift Hessenberg form leads to an algorithm
    at cost $O(n^3 + n^2m^2)$. A more sophisticated recurrent procedure
    gives the result in $O(n^3)$ steps. In particular, a normal basis for
    an extended finite field of size $q^n$ will be obtained with complexity
    $O(n^3+n^2 log q)$.

    Finally, the Frobenius form is obtained with asymptotic average
    complexity $O(n^3 log n)$."
