    "The cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) of Collins (1975)
    provides a potentially powerful method for solving many important
    mathematical problems, provided that the required amount of
    computation can be sufficiently reduced. An important component 
    of the CAD method is the projection operation. Given a set $A$ of 
    $r$-variate polynomials, the projection operation produces a 
    certain set $P$ of ($r − l$)-variate polynomials such that a CAD 
    of $r$-dimensional space for $A$ can be constructed from a CAD 
    of ($r − 1$)-dimensional space for $P$. The CAD algorithm begins 
    by applying the projection operation repeatedly, beginning 
    with the input polynomials, until univariate polynomials are
    obtained. This process is called the projection phase.",

    algebraic decomposition based quantifier elimination algorithm.
    The main improvements are
    \begin{itemize}
    \item that it does {\sl not} use the expensive augmented projection
    used by Collins' original algorithm, and
    \item that it produces {\sl simple} solution formulas by using
    three-valued logic minimization

    For example, for the quadratic problem studied by Arnon, Mignotte,

    consists of 401 atomic formulas, but that by the improved algorithm
    consists of 5 atomic formulas.",

  abstract =
    "Many important mathematical and applied mathematical problems can be
    formulated as quantifier elimination problems (QE) in elementary
    algebra and geometry. Among several proposed QE methods, the best one
    is the CAD-based method due to G. E. Collins. The major contributions
    of this thesis are centered around improving each phase of the
    CAD-based method: the projection phase, the truth-invariant CAD
    construction phase, and the solution formula construction phase
    
    Improvements in the projection phase. By generalizing a lemma on which
    the proof of the original projection operation is based, we are able
    to reduce the size of the projection set significantly, and thus speed
    up the whole QE process.
    
    Improvements in the truth-invariant CAD construction phase. By
    intermingling the stack constructions with the truth evaluations, we
    are usually able to complete quantifier elimination with only a
    partially built CAD, resulting in significant speedup.
    
    Improvements in the solution formula construction phase. By
    constructing defining formulas for a collection of cells instead of
    individual cells, we are often able to produce simple solution
    formulas, without incurring the enormous cost of augmented projection.
    
    The new CAD-based QE algorithm, which integrates all the improvements
    above, has been implemented and tested on ten QE problems from diverse
    application areas. The overall speedups range from 2 to perhaps
    300,000 times at least
    
    We also implemented D. Lazard's recent improvement on the projection
    phase. Tests on the ten QE problems show additional speedups by up to
    1.8 times."

    "Recently there has been a lot of activity in algorithms that work
    over real closed fields, and that perform such calculations as
    quantifier elimination or computing connected components of
    semi-algebraic sets. A cornerstone of this work is a symbolic sign
    determination algorithm due to Ben-Or, Kozen and Reif. In this
    paper we describe a new sign determination method based on the earlier
    algorithm, but with two advantages: (i) It is faster in the univariate
    case, and (ii) In the general case, it allows purely symbolic
    quantifier elimination in pseudo-polynomial time. By purely symbolic,
    we mean that it is possible to eliminate a quantified variable from a
    system of polynomials no matter what the coefficient values are. The
    previous methods required the coefficients to be themselves
    polynomials in other variables. Our new method allows transcendental
    functions or derivatives to appear in the coefficients.
    
    Another corollary of the new sign-determination algorithm is a very
    simple, practical algorithm for deciding existentially-quantified
    formulae of the theory of the reals. We present an algorithm that has
    a bit complexity of $n^{k+1}d^{O(k)}(c log n)^{1+\epsilon}$ randomized, or
    $n^{n+1}d^{O(k^2)}c(1+\epsilon)$ deterministic, for any 
    $\epsilon>0$, where $n$ is the number
    of polynomial constraints in the defining formula, $k$ is the number of
    variables, $d$ is a bound on the degree, $c$ bounds the bit length of the
    coefficient. The algorithm makes no general position assumptions, and
    its constants are much smaller than other recent quantifier
    elimination methods.",

     polynomial $f(x,y)$ in two variables, defined over the field \mathbb{R} 
     o rational numbers, has a zero in a real-closed field \mathbb{K} 
     containing $R^1$.
     This is done in \S{}2, but for purposes of induction it is necessary to
     consider also the case that the coefficients of $f(x,y)$ involve
     parameters; the remarks in \S{}3 will be found sufficient for this
     point. In \S{}1, the problem is reduced to a decision for equalities,
     but an induction (on the number of unknowns) could not possibly be
     carried out on equalities alone; we consider a simultaneous system
     consisting of one equality $f(x,y) = 0$ and one inequality $F(x) \ne 0$.

    "In this paper we show, by generalizing Hermite’s theorem to the
    multivariate setting, how to count the number of real or complex
    points of a discrete algebraic set which lie within some algebraic
    constraint region. We introduce a family of quadratic forms determined
    by the algebraic constraints and defined in terms of the trace from
    the coordinate ring of the variety to the ground field, and we show
    that the rank and signature of these forms are sufficient to determine
    the number of real points lying within a constraint region. In all
    cases we count geometric points, which is to say, we count points
    without multiplicity. The theoretical results on these quadratic forms
    are more or less classical, but forgotten too, and can be found also
    in [3].
    
    We insist on effectivity of the computation and complexity analysis:
    we show how to calculate the trace and signature using Gröbner bases,
    and we show how the information provided by the individual quadratic
    forms may be combined to determine the number of real points
    satisfying a conjunction of constraints. The complexity of the
    computation is polynomial in the dimension as a vector space of the
    quotient ring associated to the defining equations. In terms of the
    number of variables, the complexity of the computation is singly
    exponential. The algorithm is well parallelizable.
    
    We conclude the paper by applying our machinery to the problem of
    effectively calculating the Euler characteristic of a smooth
    hypersurface."

    "We consider linear problems in fields, ordered fields, discretely
    valued fields (with finite residue field or residue field of
    characteristic zero) and fields with finitely many independent
    orderings and discrete valuations. Most of the fields considered will
    be of characteristic zero. Formally, linear statements about these
    structures (with parameters) are given by formulas of the respective
    first-order language, in which all bound variables occur only
    linearly. We study symbolic algorithms 
    ({\sl linear elimination procedures})
    that reduce linear formulas to linear formulas of a very simple form,
    i.e. quantifier-free linear formulas, and algorithms 
    ({\sl linear decision procedures}) 
    that decide whether a given linear sentence holds in all
    structures of the given class. For all classes of fields considered,
    we find linear elimination procedures that run in double exponential
    space and time. As a consequence, we can show that for fields (with
    one or several discrete valuations), linear statements can be
    transferred from characteristic zero to prime characteristic $p$,
    provided $p$ is double exponential in the length of the statement. (For
    similar bounds in the non-linear case, see Brown, 1978.) We find
    corresponding linear decision procedures in the Berman complexity
    classes $\bigcup_{c\in N} STA(*,2^{cn},dn)$
    for $d = 1, 2$. In particular, all these procedures run in
    exponential space. The technique employed is quantifier elimination
    via Skolem terms based on Ferrante & Rackoff (1975). Using ideas of
    Fischer & Rabin (1974), Berman (1977), Fürer (1982), we establish
    lower bounds for these problems showing that our upper bounds are
    essentially tight. For linear formulas with a bounded number of
    quantifiers all our algorithms run in polynomial time. For linear
    formulas of bounded quantifier alternation most of the algorithms run
    in time $2^{O(n^k)} for fixed $k$.",
