    "This report describes techniques for resolving systems of polynomial
    equations and inequalities. The general technique is {\sl cylindrical
    algebraic decomposition}, which decomposes space into a number of
    regions, on each of which the equations and inequalities have the
    same sign. Most of the report is spent describing the algebraic and
    algorithmic pre-requisites (resultants, algebraic numbers, Sturm
    sequences, etc.), and then describing the method, first in two 
    dimensions and then in an artitrary number of dimensions.",

  title = "The Calculation of Multivariate Polynomial Resultants",
  volume = "18",
  number = "4",
  year = "1971",
  pages = "515-532",
  abstract =
    "An efficient algorithm is presented for the exact calculation of
    resultants of multivariate polynomials with integer coefficients.
    The algorithm applies modular homomorphisms and the Chinese remainder
    theorem, evaluation homomorphisms and interpolation, in reducing
    the problem to resultant calculation for univariate polynomials 
    over GF(p), whereupon a polynomial remainder sequence algorithm is used.
    
    The computing time of the algorithm is analyzed theoretically as a
    function of the degrees and coefficient sizes of its inputs. As a very
    special case, it is shown that when all degrees are equal and the
    coefficient size is fixed, its computing time is approximately
    proportional to $\lambda^{2r+1}$, where $\lambda$ is the common 
    degree and $r$ is the number of variables.
    
    Empirically observed computing times of the algorithm are tabulated
    for a large number of examples, and other algorithms are compared.
    Potential application of the algorithm to the solution of systems of
    polynomial equations is discussed.",
