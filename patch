    "Lists are a pervasive data structure in functional programs.  The
    generality and simplicity of their structure makes them expensive.
    Hindley-Mllner type inference and partial evalua- tion are all that is
    needed to optimise this structure, yielding considerable improvements
    in space and time consumption for some interesting programs.  This
    framework is applica- ble to many data types and their optimised
    representations, such as lists and parallel implementations of bags,
    or arrays and quadtrees.",
