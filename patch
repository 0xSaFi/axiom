src/input/allfns.input test for algebra examples

Goal: Axiom Literate Programming

Axiom shows an example for functions using the )display command:

)d op argscript

There is one exposed function called argscript :
  [1] (Symbol,List(OutputForm)) -> Symbol from Symbol

Examples of argscript from Symbol

argscript(Big,[a,1])

This file tests the )display command for every function in Axiom.
Functions with the same name which have a working example from every 
domain are marked at 'done'.
