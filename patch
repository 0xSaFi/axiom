    "Program verification is a relatively new application area for
    symbolic mathematical systems.  We report on an interactive
    program verification system, based on the inductive assertion method,
    which system is implemented using an existing symbolic mathematical
    language and supporting system, Reduce.  Reduce has been augmented
    with a number of capabilities which are important to program 
    verification, particularly transformations on relational and Boolean
    expressions.  We believe these capabilities would be valuable in other
    contexts and should be incorporated more widely into symbolic
    mathematical systems for general use.  The program verification
    application can serve as a guide to an appropriate definition of
    such capabilities, particularly with regard to the need to distinguish
    between undefined program variables and polynomial indeterminates.
    Additional capabilities which would benefit the program verification
    application include representation of user-defined functions by
    internal forms which directly incorporate properties such as
    commutativity and associativity (as is commonly done with plus and
    times), and a comprehensive facility for defining conditionally
    applicable transformations.",

  booktitle = "Proc. of 11th Int. Conf. on Automated Deduction",
  year = "1992",
  abstract =
    "We describe a program for finding closed form solutions to finite
    sums. The program was built to test the applicability of the proof
    planning search control technique in a domain of mathematics outwith
    induction. This experiment was successful. The series summing program
    extends previous work in this area and was built in a short time just
    by providing new series summing methods to our existing inductive
    theorem proving system CLAM. 

    One surprising discovery was the
    usefulness of the ripple tactic in summing series. Rippling is the key
    tactic for controlling inductive proofs, and was previously thought to
    be specialised to such proofs. However, it turns out to be the key
    sub-tactic used by all the main tactics for summing series. The only
    change required was that it had to be supplemented by a difference
    matching algorithm to set up some initial meta-level annotations to
    guide the rippling process. In inductive proofs these annotations are
    provided by the application of mathematical induction. This evidence
    suggests that rippling, supplemented by difference matching, will find
    wide application in controlling mathematical proofs. The research
    reported in this paper was supported by SERC grant GR/F/71799, a SERC
    PostDoctoral Fellowship to the first author and a SERC Senior
    Fellowship to the third author. We would like to thank the other

    "This paper describes a system designed to provide an interactive
    symbolic computational facility for the mathematician user. To carry
    out this objective, an experimental LISP system has been implemented
    for IBM System/360 computers. Using this LISP system as a base,
    portions of several systems have been combined and augmented to
    provide the following facilities to a user:(1) rational function
    manipulation and simplification; symbolic differentiation (Anthony
    Hearn's REDUCE)(2) symbolic integration (Joel Moses' SIN)(3)
    polynomial factorization, solution of linear differential equations,
    direct and inverse symbolic Laplace transforms (Carl Engelman's
    MATHLAB, including Knut Korsvold's simplification system)(4) unlimited
    precision integer arithmetic(5) manipulation of arrays containing
    symbolic entries(6) two-dimensional output on IBM 2741 terminals or
    IBM 2250 displays (William Martin's Symbolic Mathematical Laboratory,
    and Jonathan Millen's CHARYBDIS program from MATHLAB)(7)
    self-extending language facility (META/LISP).The user language created
    for the system incorporates a subset of "customary" mathematical
    notation. Data objects include sequences (both finite and infinite)
    and arrays of arbitrary rank. Assignment statements are the
    fundamental commands in the user language; they may contain
    "for"-clauses which restrict the domain for which the assignment is
    valid and permit "piecewise" and recursive definition of new operators
    and functions. The user may also enter syntax definition statements in
    order to introduce new notations into the system.Expressions appearing
    in assignment statements may include "where"-clauses which allow user
    control over the "environment" used in evaluation. Otherwise,
    evaluation of expressions occurs in the current environment created by
    the successive user commands, with certain operations such as
    integration, differentiation, and simplification performed
    automatically.Translators for the user language and for a resident
    higher-level procedural language facility are written in META/LISP, a
    new self-compiling translator-writing system. As a result, all input
    language facilities as well as the underlying manipulation routines
    may be interactively extended by an experienced user.",

  abstract =
    "Analytica is an automatic theorem prover for theorems in
    elementary analysis. The prover is written in Mathematica language
    and runs in the Mathematica environment. The goal of the project
    is to use a powerful symbolic computation system to prove theorems
    that are beyond the scope of previous automatic theorem
    provers. The theorem prover is also able to guarantee the
    correctness of certain steps that are made by the symbolic
    computation system and therefore prevent common errors like
    division by a symbolic expression that could be zero. In this
    paper we describe the structure of Analytica and explain the main
    techniques that it uses to construct proofs. We have tried to make
    the paper as self-contained as possible so that it will be
    accessible to a wide audience of potential users. We illustrate
    the power of our theorem prover by several non-trivial examples
    including the basic properties of the stereographic projection and
    a series of three lemmas that lead to a proof of Weierstrass's
    example of a continuous nowhere differentiable function. Each of
    the lemmas in the latter example is proved completely
    automatically."

    simulation. However, they have different strengths and weaknesses. The
    main significance of this paper -- and its most original contribution
    -- is the suggestion that symbolic simulation and theorem-proving can
    be combined in a complementary manner.  We also outline our plans for
    the development of a mathematical interface between the two approaches
    -- in particular, a semantic link between the formulation of
    higher-order logic used in the Cambridge HOL system and the
    specification language used in the COSMOS system. We believe that this
    combination offers great potential as a practical formal verification
    methodology which combines the ability to accurately model circuit

    the Mizar system lacks, and consequently presents the methods of how
