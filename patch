    "These are notes for my lectures in July, 1961, at the Advanced
    Subject Matter Institute in Algebra which was held at Oklahoma State
    University in the summer of 1961.

    Students at the Institute were provided with reprints of my paper,
    {\sl Structure and representation of nonassociate algebras} (Bulletin
    of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 61 (1955), pp469-484),
    together with copies of a selective bibliography of more recent papers
    on non-associative algebras. These notes supplement the 1955 Bulletin
    article, bringing the statements there up to date and providing
    detailed proofs of a selected group of theorems. The proofs illustrate
    a number of important techniques used in the study of nonassociative
    algebras."

    "One of the earliest surveys on nonassociative algebras is the article
    by Shirshov which introduced the phrase ``rings that are nearly
    associative''. The first book in the English language devoted to a
    systematic study of nonassociative algebras is Schafer (Scha66). A
    comprehensive exposition of the work of the Russian School is
    Zhevlakov, Slinko, Shestakov and Shirshov. A collection of open
    research problems in algebra, including many problems on
    nonassociative algebra, is the {\sl Dniester Notebook}; the survey
    article by Kuzmin and Shetakov is from the same period. Three books on
    Jordan algebras which contain substantial material on general
    nonassociative algebras are Braun and Koecher, Jacobson, and
    McCrimmon. Recent research appears in the Proceedings of the
    International Conferences on Nonassociative Algebras and its
    Applications. The present section provides very limited information on
    Lie algebras, since they are the subject of Section 16.4. The last
    part (section 9) of the present section presents three applications of
    computational linear algebra to the study of polynomial identiies for
    nonassociative algebras: pseudorandom vectors in a nonassociative
    algebra, the expansion matrix for a nonassociative operation, and the
    representation theory of the symmetric group."
