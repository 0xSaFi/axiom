    "We present new recursive serial and parallel algorithms for QR
    factorization of an $m$ by $n$ matrix. They improve performance. The
    recursion leads to an automatic variable blocking, and it also
    replaces a Level 2 part in a standard aglorithm with Level 3
    operations. However, there are significant additional costs for
    creating and performing the updates, which prohibit the efficient use
    of the recursion for large $n$. We present a quantitative analysis of
    these extra costs. This analysis leads us to introduce a hybrid
    recursive algorithm that outperforms the LAPACK algorithm DGEQRF by
    about 20\% for large square matrices up to almost a factor of 3 for
    tall thin matrices. Uniprocessor performance results are presented for
    two IBM RS/6000 SP nodes -- a 120-Mhz IBM POWER2 node and one
    processor of a four-way 332-Mhz IBM PowerPC 604e SMP node. The hybrid
    recursive algorithm reaches more than 90\% of the theoretical peak
    performance of the POWER2 node. Compared to standard block algorithms,
    the recursive approach also shows a significant advantage in the
    automatic tuning obtained from its automatic variable blocking. A
    successful parallel implementation on a four-way 332-MHz IBM PPC604e
    SMP node based on dynamic load balancing is presented. For two, three,
    and four processors it shows speedups of up to 1.97, 299, and 3.97."
