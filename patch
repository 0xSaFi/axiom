    "Orthogonal polynomials have a long history, and are still important
    objects of consideration in mathematical research as well as in
    applications in Mathematical Physics, Chemistry, and
    Engineering. Quite a lot is known about them. Particularly well-known
    are differential equations, recurrence equations, Rodrigues formulas,
    generating functions and hypergeometric representations for the
    classical systems of Jacobi, Laguerre and Hermite which can be found
    in mathematical dictionaries. Less well-known are the corresponding
    representations for the classical discrete systems of Hahn,
    Krawtchouk, Meixner and Charlier, as well as addition theorems,
    connection relations between different systems and other identities
    for these and other systems of orthogonal polynomials. The ongoing
    research in this still very active subject of mathematics expands the
    knowledge database about orthogonal polynomials continuously. In the
    last few decades the classical families have been extended to a rather
    large collection of polynomial systems, the so-called Askey-Wilson
    scheme, and they have been generalized in other ways as well.

    Recently new algorithmic approaches have been discovered to compute
    differential, recurrence and similar equations from series or integral
    representations. These methods turn out to be quite useful to prove or
    detect identities for orthogonal polynomial systems. Further
    algorithms to detect connection coefficients or to identify polynomial
    systems from given recurrence equations have been developed. Although
    some algorithmic methods had been known already in the last century,
    their use was rather limited due to the immense amount of
    calculations. Only the existence and distribution of computer algebra
    systems makes their use simple and useful for everybody.

    In this plenary lecture an overview is given of how algorithmic
    methods implemented in computer algebra systems can be used to prove
    identities about and to detect new knowledge for orthogonal
    polynomials and other hypergeometric type special functions.
    Implementations for this type of algorithms exist in Maple,
    Mathematica and REDUCE, and maybe also in other computer algebra
    systems. Online demonstrations will be given using Maple V.5."

    "We identify three main objectives for computer aided reasoning
    enhancing the techniques available for mathematical experimentation,
    developing community standards for experiment and modelling and
    developing methods which will make computation more acceptable as part
    of a proof. We discuss three areas of research which address these:
    the use of theorem proving techniques to enhance or extend
    mathematical software systems, support for formal methods techniques
    to increase the reliability of such systems, and the use of computer
    aided formal reasoning in support of mathematical practice. This last
    includes activities such as formalizing systems for computational
    mathematics or visualization so that they can still be used informally
    but generate a formal development, and developing techniques to
    provide assistance in the initial stages of developing a new theory.

    By mathematics here we mean the activities of working research
    mathematicians, producing new results in pure or applied mathematics,
    although we touch briefly on some questions concerning the
    applications of computational mathematics and simulation in research
    science and engineering. We have left out several other related areas
    entirely: logical questions of decidability, soundness or
    completeness, theoretical computer science issues of semantics,
    computability or complexity, foundational issues such as
    constructivity, computer aided proofs about software and hardware, and
    the use of computers in mathematical education at all levels and in
    heuristic discovery. In particular foundational questions about
    computation have transformed mathematical logic, computation has made
    constructive proof feasible, and effective notions of practice for
    proofs about hardware and software are by no means well understood.
    However these matters fall outside the scope of this paper."
