    "We define the notion of an {\sl inductively defined type} in the
    Calculus of Constructions and show how inductively defined types can
    be represented by closed types. We show that all primitive recursive
    functional over these inductively defined types are also
    representable. This generalizes work by Bohm and Berarducci on
    synthesis of functions on term algebras in the second-order
    polymorphic $\lambda$-calculus ($F_2$). We give several applications
    of this generalization, including a representation of $F_2$-programs
    in $F_3$, along with a definition of functions {\bf reify}, {\bf
    reflect}, and {\bf eval} for $F_2$ in $F_3$. We also show how to
    define induction over inductively defined types and sketch some
    results that show that the extension of the Calculus of Construction
    by induction principles does not alter the set of functions in its
    computational fragment, $F_\omega$. This is because a proof by
    induction can be {\bf realized} by primitive recursion, which is
    already definable in $F_\omega$.",
