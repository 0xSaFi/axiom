    "In an earlier paper we began a discussion of the use of overloaded
    languages for support of computer algebra systems. Here we extend that
    notion to provide a more detailed approach to Automatic
    Differentiation or Algorithm Differention (AD).
    
    This paper makes three points. 1. It is extremely easy to do express
    AD by overloading in Common Lisp. 2. While the resulting program is
    not the most efficient approach in terms of run-time, it is quite
    small and very general. It also interacts nicely with some other kinds
    of generic arithmetic. 3. A more efficient AD compile-time program
    generation approach is described as well.",
