  abstract =
    "{\sl Mathematical Components} is the name of a library of formalized
    mathematic for the COQ system. It covers a veriety of topics, from the
    theory of basic data structures (e.g. numbers, lists, finite sets) to
    advanced results in various flavors of algebra. This library
    constitutes the infrastructure for the machine-checked proofs of the
    Four Color Theorem and the Odd Order Theorem.

    The reason of existence of this books is to break down the barriers to
    entry. While there are several books around covering the usage of the
    COQ system and the theory it is based on, the Mathematical Components
    library is build in an unconventional way. As a consequence, this book
    provides a non-standard presentation of COQ, putting upfront the
    formalization choices and the proof style that are the pillars of the
    library.

    This book targets two classes of public. On one hand, newcomers, even
    the more mathematically inclined ones, find a soft introduction to the
    programming language of COQ, Gallina, and the Ssreflect proof
    language.  On the other hand accustomed COQ users find a substantial
    accound of the formalization style that made the Mathematical
    Components library possible.

    By no means does this book pretend to be a complete description of COQ
    or Ssreflect: both tools already come with a comprehensive user
    manual.  In the course of the book, the reader is nevertheless invited
    to experiment with a large library of formalized concepts and she is
    given as soon as possible sufficient tools to prove non-trivial
    mathematical results by reusing parts of the library. By the end of
    the first part, the reader has learnt how to prove formally the
    infinitude of prime numbers, or the correctnes of the Euclidean's
    division algorithm, in a few lines of proof text.",
