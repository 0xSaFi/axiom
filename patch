  abstract = 
    "We describe a Coq formalization of a subset of the x86
     architecture. One emphasis of the model is brevity: using dependent
     types, type classes and notation we give the x86 semantics a makeover
     that counters its reputation for baroqueness. We model bits, bytes,
     and memory concretely using functions that can be computed inside Coq
     itself; concrete representations are mapped across to mathematical
     objects in the SSREFLECT library (naturals, and integers modulo 2n)
     to prove theorems. Finally, we use notation to support conventional
     assembly code syntax inside Coq, including lexically-scoped
     labels. Ordinary Coq definitions serve as a powerful ``macro'' feature
     for everything from simple conditionals and loops to stack-allocated
     local variables and procedures with parameters. Assembly code can be
     assembled within Coq, producing a sequence of hex bytes. The assembler
     enjoys a correctness theorem relating machine code in memory to a
     separation-logic formula suitable for program verification."
