    "A package of 38 low level subprograms for many of the basic
    operations of numerical linear algebra is presented. The package is
    intended to be used with Fortran. The operations in the package
    include dot product, elementary vector operations, Givens
    transformations, vector copy and swap, vector norm, vector scaling,
    and the determination of the index of the vector component of largest
    magnitude."
