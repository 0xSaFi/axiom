    "The complexity of modern computing platforms has made it extremely
    difficult to write numerical code that achieves the best possible
    performance. Straightforward implementations based on algorithms that
    minimize the operations count often fall short in performance by at
    least one order of magnitude. This tutorial introduces the reader to a
    set of general techniques to improve the performance of numerical
    code, focusing on optimizations for the computer's memory hierarchy. 
    Further, program generators are discussed as a way to reduce the 
    implementation and optimization effort. Two running examples are 
    used to demonstrate these techniques: matrix-matrix multiplication 
    and the discrete Fourier transform."
