    Let $K$, $S$, $D$ be a division ring an endomorphism and a
    $S$-derivation of $K$, respectively. In this setting we introduce
    generalized noncommutative symmetric functions and obtain Vi\'ete
    formula and decompositions of different operators. $W$-polynomials
    show up naturally, their connetions with $P$-independency. Vandermonde
    and Wronskian matrices are briefly studied. The different linear
    factorizations of $W$-polynomials are analysed. Connections between
    the existence of LLCM (least left common multiples) of monic linear
    polynomials with coefficients in a ring and the left duo property are
    established at the end of the paper."

    "Pseudo-linear algebra is the study of common properties of linear
    differential and difference operators. We introduce in this paper its
    basic objects (pseudo-derivations, skew polynomials, and pseudo-linear
    operators) and describe several recent algorithms on them, which, when
    applied in the differential and difference cases, yield algorithms for
    uncoupling and solving systems of linear differential and difference
    equations in closed form."
