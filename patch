    "The Successive Resultants Algorithm (SRA) is a root-finding algorithm for
    polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ and was introdoced at ANTS in 2014.
    THe algorithm is efficient when the characteristic $p$ is small and 
    $n > 1$. In this paper, we abstract the core SRA algorithm to arbitrary
    finite fields and present three instantiations of our general algorithm,
    one of which is novel and makes use of a series of isogenies derived
    from elliptic curves with sufficiently smooth order.",
