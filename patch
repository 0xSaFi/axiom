    equalities and inequalities are in factored or partially- factored
    form. The combinatorial part of a formula contains only
    ‘‘monomial inequalities’’,which are sign conditions on monomials.  We 
    give efficient algorithms for answering some basic questions about
    conjunctions of monomial inequalities and prove the
    NP-Completeness/Hardness of some others. By simplifying the
    combinatorial part of a Tarski formula, and mapping the simplified
    combinatorial part back to a Tarski formula, we obtain non-trivial
    simplifications without algebraic operations.",

    We give solutions to two problems of elementary algebra and geometry:
    (1) find conditions on real numbers $p$, $q$, and $r$ so that the
    polynomial function $f(x)=x^4+px^2+qx+r$ is nonnegative for all real
    $x$ and (2) find conditions on real numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$ so that
    the ellipse $\frac{(x-e)^2}{q^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}-1=0$ lies inside the
    unit circle $y^2+x^2-1=0$. Our solutions are obtained by following the
    basic outline of the method of quantifier elimination by cylindrical
    algebraic decomposition (Collins, 1975), but we have developed, and
    have been considerably aided by, modified versions of certain of its
    steps. We have found three equally simple but not obviously equivalent
    solutions for the first problem, illustrating the difficulty of
    obtaining unique ``simplest'' solutions to quantifier elimination
    problems of elementary algebra and geometry.",

    "I.  Introduction.  Tarski in 1948, published a quantifier 
    elimination method for the elementary theory of real closed fields 
    (which he had discoverd in 1930).  As noted by Tarski, any quantifier
    elimination method for this theory also provides a decision method,
    which enables one to decide whether any sentence of the theory is
    true or false.  Since many important and difficult mathematical
    problems can be expressed in this theory, any computationally
    feasible quantifier elimination algorithm would be of utmost
    significance.  
    
    However, it became apparent that Tarski's method required too much
    computation to be practical except for quite trivial problems.
    Seidenberg in 1954, described another method which he thought
    would be more efficient.  A third method was published by Cohen in
    1969.  Some significant improvements of Tarski's method have been
    made by W. Boge, which are described in a thesis by Holthusen
    
    This paper describes a completely new method which I discoverd in
    February 1973.  This method was presented in a seminar at Stanford
    University in March 1973 and in abstract form at a symposium at 
    Carnegie-Mellon University in May 1973.  In August 1974 a full 
    presentation of the method was delivered at the EUROSAM 74 Conference 
    in Stockholm, and a preliminary version of the present paper was 
    published in the proceedings of that conference.",

    procedure for real closed fields. The algorithm has subsequently found
    diverse applications (optimization, curve display); new applications
    have been proposed (term rewriting systems, motion planning). In the
    present two-part paper, we give an algorithm for determining the pairs
    of adjacent cells in a cad of $E^2$. This capability is often needed
    in applications. In Part I we describe the essential features of the
