    "The methods of mechanizing mathematics are realized by means of
    compputer software for solving scientiØc and engineering problems via
    symbolic and hybrid computation. This chapter provides a collection of
    geometric theorem provers and algebraic equations solvers that are
    pieces of mathematical software based mostly on Wu's method and were
    developed mainly by members of the extended Wu group. The early
    theorem provers, though e±cient, were written in basic programming
    languages and on primitive computers. Now there exist more powerful
    and mature geometric theorem provers of which some have already been
    published as commercial software. On the other hand, building ef-
    fective equations solvers is still at the experimental stage and
    remains for further research and development."

    "Around 1980 two new directions in science and technique came
    together. One was Buchberger’s algorithms in order to handle Groebner
    bases in an effective way for solving polynomial equations. The second
    one was the development of the personal computers. This was the
    starting point of a computational perspective in commutative algebra
    and algebraic geometry. In 1991 the three authors invented the first
    edition of their book as an introduction for undergraduates to some
    interesting ideas in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry with a
    strong perspective to practical and computational aspects. A second
    revised edition appeared in 1996. That means from the very beginning
    the book provides a bridge for the new, computational aspects in the
    field of commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

    To be more precise, the book gives an introduction to Buchberger’s
    algorithm with applications to syzygies, Hilbert polynomials, primary
    decompositions. There is an introduction to classical algebraic
    geometry with applications to the ideal membership problem, solving
    polynomial equations, and elimination theory. Some more spectacular
    applications are about robotics, automatic geometric theorem proving,
    and invariants of finite groups. It seems to the reviewer to carry
    coals to Newcastle for estimating the importance and usefulness of the
    book. It should be of some interest to ask how many undergraduates
    have been introduced to algorithmic aspects of commutative algebra and
    algebraic geometry following the line of the book. The reviewer will
    be sure that this will continue in the future too.  

    What are the changes to the previous editions? There is a significant
    shorter proof of the Extension Theorem, see 3.6 in Chapter 3,
    suggested by A.H.M. Levelt. A major update has been done in Appendix C
    ``Computer Algebra Systems''. This concerns in the main the section
    about MAPLE. Some minor updated information concern the use of AXIOM,
    CoCoA, Macaulay2, Magma, Mathematica, and SINGULAR. This reflects
    about the recent developments in Computer Algebra Systems. It
    encourages an interested reader to more practical exercises. The
    authors have made changes on over 200 pages to enhance clarity and
    correctness. Many individuals have reported typographical errors and
    gave the authors feedback on the earlier editions. The book is
    well-written. The reviewer guesses that it will become more and more
    difficult to earn 1 dollar (sponsored by the authors) for every new
    typographical error as it was the case also with the first and second
    edition. The reviewer is sure that it will be a excellent guide to
    introduce further undergraduates in the algorithmic aspect of
    commutative algebra and algebraic geometry."
