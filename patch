    regime, the solutions of the specialized systems may be given
    uniformly. For homogeneous linear systems, or for systems were the
    right hand side is arbitrary, this small set is irredunant. We discuss
    in detail practical issues concerning implementations, with particular
    emphasis on simplification of results. Examples are given based on a
    close implementation of the algorithm in SCRATCHPAD II. We also give a
    complexity analysis of the Gaussian elimination method and compare

    We propose a new algorithm, similar to Hermite's method for the

    fields (in particular that the exponentials be weakly normalized), we
    can avoid the introduction of arbitrary constants which have to be
    solved for later.

    We also define a class of fields known as exponentially reduced, and
    show that solutions of Risch differential equations which arise from
    integrating in these fields satisfy the ``natural'' degree constraints
    in their main variables, and we conjecture (after Risch and Norman)

    We have also found a theorem which states, roughly speaking, that if

    applications, we get a generalisation of the residue formulas used in
    symbolic integration algorithms to $n^{th}$-order formulas. We also
    get an algorithm that computes explicitly the principlal parts at all

    the coefficients of the series instead of the one generated by the

    by a monoid, and we allow partial orders on the monomials. The ideas

    "Many ambitious computer algebra systems were initially designed in a
    flush of enthusiasm, with the goal of automating any symbolic
    mathematical manipulation “correctly.” Historically, this approach
    resulted in programs that implicitly used certain identities to
    simplify expressions. These identities, which very likely seemed
    universally true to the programmers in the heat of writing the CAS,
    (and often were true in well-known abstract algebraic domains) later
    needed re-examination when such systems were extended for dealing with
    kinds of objects unanticipated in the original design. These new
    objects are generally introduced to the CAS by extending “generically”
    the arithmetic or other operations.  For example, approximate floats
    do not have the mathematical properties of exact integers or
    rationals.  Complex numbers may strain a system designed for
    real-valued variables. In the situation examined here, we consider two
    categories of “extended” numbers: ∞ or undefined, and real
    intervals. We comment on issues raised by these two troublesome
    notions, how their introduction into a computer algebra system may
    require a (sometimes painful) reconsideration and redesign of parts of
    the program, and how they are related. An alternative (followed most
    notably by the Axiom system is to essentially envision a “meta” CAS
    defined in terms of categories and inheritance with only the most
    fundamental built-in concepts; from these one can build many variants
    of specific CAS features. This approach is appealing but can fails to

    We need to have a convergence in design and standards for encoding new
    or pre-existing (typically paper-based) documents in order to most
    efficiently meet the needs of all these groups. Various effort, some
    loosely coordinated, but just as often competing, are trying to set
    standards and build tools.
    
    We approach this by first dividing the task into visual, syntactic,
    and semantic components. These specifications can focus attention on
    the addressing requirements of the different groups. Additionally, 
    these components rely on a structure for documents that incorporates
    existing library models and extends them to new modes of operation.
    Berkeley's MVD is one plausible structure which will allow prototype
    development and explorations.",

    "We propose to concentrate on investigations of technology in support
    of advanced scientific computation, based on a higher-level view of the
    relationship of mathematical modeling to computation. This is based on
    the following considerations:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Symbolic mathematical manipulation and computer algebra systems: 
    These are tools and techniques that support problem solving, code 
    development, comprehension, debugging and partial evaluation
    (the principle behind many optimization techniques).
    \item Data modeling: in particular, the use of IEEE floating-point 
    number representations and operations.
    \item Closed form or exact solutions: For some sub-problems of 
    scientific interest, numerical solutions are not the only paradigm. 
    The availability of exact solutions, or symbolic-approximation solutions 
    has advanced along with computing technology too. 
    \item The use of scripting languages: the linkage of high-performance 
    library routines to graphical interfaces for data analysis and model setup
    can be enhanced by symbolic support and high-level scripting languages.
    \item Extending the use of remote computation. We are now using standard 
    network connections for the acquisition of complex data (in this case, 
    symbolic solution of definite integrals).

  abstract =
    "Programs in symbolic algebraic manipulation systems can compute
    certain classes of symbolic indefinite integrals in closed form. Although
    these answers are ordinarily formally correct algebraic anti-derivatives,
    their form is often unsuitable for further numerical or even analytical 
    processing. In particular, we address cases in which such ``exact answers''
    when numerically evaluated may give less-accurate answers than numerical
    approximations from first principles! The symbolic formulas may also
    behave inappropriately near singularities. We discuss techniques, based
    in part on the calculus of divided differences, for improving the form of
    results of symbolic mathematics systems. In particular, computer alge
    algebra systems must take explicit account of the possibility that they are
    producing not “mathematics” but templates of programs consisting of se
    sequences of arithmetic operations. In brief, mathematical correctness is
    not enough. Forms produced by rational integration programs are used
    for examples.",

    "Computer algebra systems (CAS) are supposed to do mathematics. 
    Unfortunately, much of human mathematics presentation and
    manipulation depends on humans to understand what is going on more
    generally. This context is often not made available to the computer
    system, and so it will sometimes fail to make the right guess at the
    meaning of constructions, unless they are made unambiguous. Among many
    issues, one that has been raised and resolved, is the need for
    attributing properties to operators that distinguish between ``the name
    of the operation'' and ``the operation itself''.  
    
    As a simple example, referential transparency requires that if $x = y$,
    then any true statement $P(x)$ about $x$ must be true about $y$, namely
    $P(y)$ is also true.
    
    Consider now the well-known equation $sin(0) = 0$, and the statement 
    $P(r) :=$ ``r = 0 is a rule to simplify the sin() function''.  The
    statement $P(sin(0))$ is clearly true. Therefore $P(0)$ should be true
    as well. It is not, since $0 = 0$ is not a rule to simplify $sin()$.
    
    The point here is that $sin(0)$ is not equal to 0 if sin is treated as
    the name of an operation. Perhaps it is a character string, or a data
    structure of some sort: a noun phrase. The corresponding expression
    including the verb form of sin is one in which $sin(0)$ can be
    simplified to something equivalent, but in some sense preferable. Here
    it is reasonable to replace it by 0.",
